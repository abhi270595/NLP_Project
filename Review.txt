- It is good if you have internet than you can download the stuff, else, you can't  

+ It's cool and small  

+ ...the 'Windows' software to download songs to the device DOES NOT WORK WITH Windows NT.<p>Also, the headphones are low quality so you might want to get some better ones because the actual quality of the audio signal is  pretty good.  The solid-state walkman has arrived.  

+ Since the firts day I saw it, i knew it was going to be a great product. I just bought mine here on amazon.com!!!  What a terrific idea! I think it's going to be the standard for music, not only for the people that are  &quot;on-line&quot;but everybody as well. I highly recommend it!  

+ RIO is really great, but Diamond should increase its memory so as to really worth the money.  

- The software on the RCA Kazoo is almost impossible for me to figure out.  The RCA kazoo's Headphones also "are bad".  I think it is too expensive for what its worth and i am asking you not to buy this peice of junk.  

+ great player for the first time buyer. it's tiny, and very cute. has all the basics. very nice price.  

+ Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  ilikethis.info/ipod-nano  

+ like  very  mach  the  product   for     had   voice  recorder  al    radio    very  mucho   also    for the  batery  is      work   more  time  other  product  today  on   the  market    realy   recomet  the   product  other  buy    is  realy  good  product    also    the  pray   in  amazon    

- Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.   

- I bought a 6gb Micro in 4/06..after several months the screen locked up...I tried everything including a new battery...$200 bucks in the trash! Don't buy Creative anything..terrible product....... terrible company..   

+ Please go to RCA's website and download and install the lastest firmware update. Lots of enhancements and feature upgrades  Firmware:: RD2765 Lyra mp3 Hard Drive Firmware/Application Upgrade (Version 1.25)  

- pmc 120 wasn't worth the $100 I spent.  Music quality is fair but glitches frequently.  I've been unable to make it through an entire video without the player freezing.  The picture quality is low and did not meet my expectations.  

+ I've been using it on a daily basis for more than 1 year already and it's really great. Absolutely no glitches so far (I've dropped it on the floor SEVERAL times), great battery life !  

+ ...the sound quality when recording voice through the built-in mike is quite mediocre.  I had hoped for recording quality like the iRiver units (which is excellent.)  I'm returning mine, as this was an important feature for me.  

+ excellent mp3 player.  extra small and light.  just drag mp3's over with or without folders. i like that it uses AAA batteries. one problem i had is it stopped responding, but after firmware update it works perfectly.  

+ I got the product within the day the email was sent that it had been shipped and in perfect condition.  

+ I love the ipod mini it holds so much music and is so small. Also the 18 hour battery life is great. This is perfect for holding my hip hop music collection. If you dont have alot of music I would also recomend the ipod shuffle. But my ipod mini has been great so far. Go Ipods!  

+ ive had many ipods like the ipod video and shuffle but they all are no compiticion compared to this it is amazingly duribly i fell on a rail snowboarding and it didint do anything only one downer its pretty hard to find but other then that its perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

+ If you ar reading this, then perhaps this is would be your first IPOD you've ever purchased.  Because, there is nothing different about this Ipod than the others.  it's a very nice MP3 Player.  All of the Ipods are.  If 4GB is enough space for you, then this is a great device to play your music.  

- I had to replace it because it crashed on me and I only had it for about 5 months.  

+ It is a great gadget to have for the summer. I love the size of it. I am glad I purchased it. I enjoy having it at my gradma's house this summer. She does not have to listen to loud music since I have my Ipod.:)  

+ really great mp3 player, and this mp3 player makes u look cool i dont know why :p  

+ This little player is just what we wanted. It recharges at the computer, so I am not buying batteries everyday. The download software is user friendly and my kids figured it out on their own. We are very satisfied with our Zen player and thinking of getting another.  

- Had good luck in the past with Creative Labs.  Love the software.  But had last Zen V plus for 6 months and died on me.  Had this one one month and screen got corrupted and eventually couldn't see at all.  Very disappointed.   

+ This player has been working fine for me.  I only use it for about 1 hour, M-F, on the way home from work.  I had to buy new headphones because the ones that came with it hurt my ears, otherwise, no complaints.    

+ I love my Creative Zen. I have downloaded a bunch of music easily and have been enjoying it since I recieved it. I highly recommend it as a more affordable version of the Ipod.   

- It list good specs but I wouldn't know as it doesn't work with XP home and there are noe firmware updates/drivers for it.   The companies web site is pathetic with no forums or any way to give feedback.  It might make a good paper weight tho...  

- WOrked OK as an MP3 player and FM tuner.   (Reception marginal).  However, my son dropped it from 3 ft onto ceramic tile and that crashed the harddrive.  Permanently dead.    That is too fragile for a portable music device.  

+ two things, is there a case for this thing you can buy anywhere? also, is it the same size as the 20 GB model? Thanks!   

+ Great item.  It's and iPod what else need you say?  My wife loves it.  

+ the ipod is great! it got here in good time and great shape. it has plenty of memory to hold tons of music. it is a great size to carry around and use anywhere anytime.  

+ We purchased 3 of these for our kids and they love it and have not had any problems with them.  We'll be upgrading them to a nano when the hard drives on these start to fail.  So far they haven't.  

+ Love it.  It's great.  Easy to use.  Small.  Excellent. No complaints.  

+ Excellent value.handles and works well for Audio books, lots of storage space for many books and lots of music.  

+ I was a little disappointed by the condition of the iPod-several scratches and dents. So I think it was a bit overpriced, considering the appearance.  Since returning the iPod once for service, it has worked fine.    

+ This produc was delivered earlier than expected and in great shape.  My family loves having an iPOD to enjoy their favorite music.  Great service and a great item.  Thanks.  

+ I ordered this item on March 22, but not shipped until today(April 27), why?  

- Theres some problems with it... Software   isent that good, lots problems,I hate usb port carger, runs down Laptop batteries faster  

+ Although I like the product overall, I'm frustrated with the useless nickel-sized ear buds.  They are very uncomfortable and do not stay in place. If you buy this product, get a pair of ear buds as well   

+ the company sent me a great product, at a great price. im glad there is an ebay to shop around for great deals.  

+ Very Good !  As far as the owner, the ipod is well take care.  

+ Apple has dominated the MP# market and when you buy one you will understand.  

+ This is my first iPod and I LOVE it!!  I have all of my 200 cds on it and still 50+ GB free.  Amazing.  Plus I have pictures on it that I've transferred from my camera.  

- But now its gone bad!! Iriver support is not responding. I can't down load the updater to my H10,it won't reformat, and emails are getting me nowhere. Worst yet I miss my music. Like a relationship gone bad, it was great while it lasted, but the end was really sour.   

+ Got this as a gift for my Girl Friend.  She is very pleased with it.  She has had it for about 18 months now, uses it every day, and it works as well as the day she got it.  

+ It is beautiful mp3 player.  Looks special and different from a typical Ipod.   Tons of memory; smaller than 20 GB Ipod.  Easy controls, colorful display, cool USB host feature. Con: bad battery life.    Great price!    

- I have one buy from bestbuy at end of 2005, one month later I found when conect to computer the mp3 automaticly recharge and remember it. One year after the battery only can use about two hours, two years after very defecult to use it and almost all time conect to the charge.  

+ this is an easy to use device that is perfect for the gym. it holds plenty of music and is simple to operate. earbuds are not so hot but for 10$ I added a more secure headset that doesn't fall out on the torture machines at the gym!  Love it!  

+ I bought this for my 12 yr old son for Christmas. He absolutly loves it. It is very easy to use. He is always on the go and seems to hold up to an active kid. We have had not problems with it. It holds a lot of songs. It is very easy to use and quite easy to download CD's onto it.   

+ The YP-T7X is a solid mp3 player.  The FM radio works well.  It is a good device to use while running.  I also have a Creative Zen and the two devices are complimentary (one for storing all of my music and one for use while running).  

+ I bought this player last week and frankly I love each and every aspect of this player. It's amazing how so many features have been packed on to this small device - from a voice recorder to picture viewer - this mp3 player is truly an Ipod killer.   

+ Easy to use.  Tiny.  Light.  Fine sound.  Lots of features.  Excellent SW included.  Plugs right in to USB (no cable to lose).  Built-in FM radio.  Runs on 1 AAA battery.  Long battery life.  Great price.  What's not to love?        

+ Wow. What a difference a generation of MP3 players can make. Absolutely impressed with this model.  This thing has everything you could possibly think of, and more.  Especially like the progressive scanning. Very helpful when listening to long audio tracks.  

+ with all that already written, there is no doubt its the best player in market. I read the reviews and got this item and boy !!! its laden with features that actually work....  this is the mp3 player of players !!!  

+ Very compact size/weight is great for clipping onto workout wear. Easy to use..great sound..great little screen..good battery... Love it !  

+ Its fundamentally wonderful device squeezing in lots of features in its cute n tiny shape. I didn't see any player as compact as this. Only con I find is the price, probably the highest among its peers.  

+ IF you are considering this you might want to wait until may when sony releases the NW-HD5, it has an even longer battery life (40 hours ATRAC, 30 hours Mp3) and a user-replaceable battery. Pictures are on engadget.com  

+ This is the perfect mp3 player, with everything you want. It holds up to 13,000 songs, smaller and cuter than an i-pod, better sound quality than any other make, shuffle options, larger toggle navigation button. Just buy it - you won't be disappointed!  

+ Excellent! Fast service, good price and ONLY $5.00 Shipping by UPS ground from Colorado to California (do not "eat" the cost of Shipping & Handling like many others!) Thank You  

- Only someone who is from another planet would buy this player. It has problems playing MP3 and WMA files. It forces you to use the dumb Sony software. It costs more than an IPOD.. In short.. buy something else. Sony get your act together.. You invented this category and now you have lost it  

+ Fantastic player with good software to burn CD's as well. Able to type in and search by Artist, genre and albums. Great sound quality and bass booster options. A* product!  

+ A good solid player with amazing battery life, sound quality, it's small, lightweight, easy navigation buttons. A joy to use  

+ almost everyone said is correct about this tiny lil' player.  but i'd like to add that we CAN transfer music of files even when there is no charger connected to it.  

+ I don't understand why everyone is complaining this is awesome, I think it sounds very crisp. it has not frozen on me i think  that everyone is going to have something bad to say about everything, but i think it is great. I use it to go jogging and it has never skipped. Its just great.  

- This is the second mp3 player that I've had from philips.  The first one never worked and this one died after 5 months of use.  When you get the "flickering of death" nothing in the manual works.  My last philips product EVER!!!!    

- I saved my money up for this Philips mp3 player.  When I got it I loved it.  I got it in June 2005, it just recently stopped working in January 2007.  It only worked for a year and a half.  I was very disappointed with this mp3.  I will never get this very mp3 again.  

+ Thanks for the good service we received on this item.  It arrived in good shape and as expected.  

+ best product! easy to use, the batteries last forever, and i love the video and picture options!!! definately a must have!  

+ Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod Video 60GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  awesomestufffree.com/ipod-video  

+ I love this mp3 player because it's a great value.  It costs much less than an Ipod, and I think it works very well.  Using it takes a little getting used to, but no more than other products.    

+ I bought this for my 30 year old daughter and she loves it.  I didn't want to spend twice the money for an I-pod and bought this figuring that if she got some enjoyment out of it, it would be worth the $180 bucks.  She loves it so much her mother-in-law is buying one for our 9 year old grandson.    

+ I have had my Toshiba Gigabeat F40 for at least a year.  It works great and I have had no issues.  I have 222 artists and 518 albums on it so far.  I use Windows Media Player and I don't have any problems downloading music.    

+ This baby not only looks good its da biz i got it recently no regrets!   

+ Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site:  http://snurl.com/ipodnano4  

+ I rate this product ++ compared to Shuffle. It has a very nice and sexy looking display. No need to say about music quality. Earplug coming with this player is of cheap quality. Would suggest for a better quality headfones.   

- Listen to the other reviews.  The proprietary sony format ia a pain and kills this for me.  I usually love sony stuff and the hardware may be good but the proprietary format conversion is too much for me.  I switched to a SanDisk that works well for me.  

- - can't use it play 80% of the mp3 files on my hard disk. - its a real pain to get any file on to the device - no support whatsoever for unicode file names  now i use it mainly as a storage device. mp3 player? forget it.  sony has completely ruined its reputation.  

+ If you're thinking of buying an I-pod Shuffle, get this instead.  It's cheaper, easy-to-use, has a screen so you can select songs/albums, and fits more music.  Oh, and it has a pretty good battery life.    

+ An excellent item. The only drawback is that the system does not receive radio signals very well without something plugged in acting like an antenna. When the antenna or the power cord are plugged in reception is good but bad otherwise.  

+ I'VE FOUND THAT IF YOU SCAN TOO QUICKLY THROUGH SONGS THE UNIT LIKES TO LOCK UP. PLUS MY RESET BUTTON WONT WORK. OTHER THAN THAT, AWSOME DEAL FOR $45.  

+ hi from what I see the ipod nano has great durabiulty great sound and lots of other things.I do not have one but I hope I will be getting one for one of my presents .My friend has it.It is so cool.Good jod apple  

+ hi from what I see the ipod nano has great durabiulty great sound and lots of other things.I do not have one but I hope I will be getting one for my bar mitzva.My friend has it.It is so cool.Good jod apple  

+ The battery will eventually wear out. But becase of integrated battery type in this device, it is likely  you will  be in hard time of replacing it.   

+ After having an initial problem with FedEx-not the sellers fault-product arrived as stated and works without problem-it is reconditioned which explains the crazy low price(got it for the same price as a new shuffle would cost)  

+ It works great though it did come with a pretty big knick in the screen.  The description did sayt hat it was used but that there were no noticable blemishes, this was quite noticable.  The 10 yr old getting it for Christmas didn't mind.  

+ Great product! It was exactly how it was described and I had no problems with the transaction at all. I bought this as a gift and he was very happy with it.  

+ I love everything about this little mp3. Its my first Ipod, so far so good. My only issue is that when I download a live set or DJ Mixed cd from Itunes, when I listen to it in my ipod there are gaps between songs. A little help with this? I'll appreciate it!   

+ This is by far the BEST flash-based MP3 player I have ever used.  It is incredibly user friendly.  Great sound and picture with all the bells and whistles.  If you are consider and iPod or an MP3 player, definitely get this one.  

+ [...] It's not fake, I learned about it through CNN news. Good simple product.  No major drawbacks, unless you're a big music buff and 4gigs is too small.  But with the size of this thing, 4gigs is fair and adaquate.  

+ Used but functional, dent on the back which was not directly identified. But I expected some wear. Battery is great. Happy with my purchase got a great deal.  

+ hope this nano iPod would still be on sale...  I don-t like the new one.. too small...  

+ Elegant design, easy to use, only downside is there are better versions on the market now.  

+ this was my grandson's present last year from his Mom and Dad.  He loves it  

- I didn't like this at all...it is really hard to use, has confusing operations, it feels really cheap, and the picture quality leaves ALOT to be desired.  Stay away from this one...  

+ I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS.  HE RESEARCHS EVERYTHING HE BUYS AND THIS IS WHAT HE WANTED.  HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THE MP3 AND I AM GLAD I DID MY HOMEWORK.  RECEIVED IN SHORT PERIOD OF TIME-GOOD JOB.  

+ first mp3 player for me. i am very pleased with it. easy to use and very well made. can do a lot with it for a small price.  

+ Scroll wheel very laggy.  Almost crashed as I was waiting for navigation menu to scroll down.  Great for listening to while driving!  Comes with amazing earbud headphones!  Didn't notice the sirens and lights in my rear view mirror for at least 5 miles!  

+ I've own one of these before and went back to buying another one. GREAT PRODUCT and very user-friendly.  

+ Short life span and very sensible controls than can be fixed easily reflashing the unit. No mayor complains.  

+ Bought this as a present for my girl's birthday, and it is really very tiny. The pictures do not provide a good reference point, but we are talking about half a pack of smokes in size. A good little player from what I can tell, she loves it.  

+ Good quality sound. Holds up to 3,000 songs and still has an F.M. radio. Also this baby coms with a built in mic so u are able to record lectures and also record off the radio. I would definitly get this over an ipod mini.  

+ i liked it because it was my first mp3 player and it's easy to control, my friend brought over her video ipod and i could even make my way around it.  nowhere near the experience though, but like i said great for beginers  

- This flash drive seemed like a great idea.  Unfortunatly, the player has trouble playing most of the music files I transfer to it from my iBook.  The company says its compatible with Apple computers, but normally the player will only play a handful of the songs I transfer to it!  

+ The navagation buttons are a little odd.  The music seemed to be glitchy, but  I think that was my software I was using.  It has been running fine for the last 6 months.  Doesn't eat up batteries that bad.  I use it jogging and has a hold button which is nice.  

+ Works great, but drains battery life rather quickly I think. Very handy to have around when you need a usb flash drive.  

- do not buy this item. i brought 2 and they both failed within 2 weeks. you get what you pay for.  

+ This Mp 3 player is great... no doubt about it. It easy to use and has a cool screen. Sounds better than any stereo I've heard before. A little over $100 is a bargain!.  

+ Software a little confusing, but overall a good MP3 player.  My granddaughter is really enjoying it.  

+ I purchased the Sony Walkman 512 For my 18 year old granddaughter for her graduation, she loves it ,she also jogs everyday and say it has great sound Quality ,also she has downloaded  her music with no promblems.  We rate it a 5 star. Theresa in Mandeville La.  

+ This MP3 player is very user friendly and easy to follow directions for getting started.  Also love the clip on.   

+ i bought it about 2 mounth ago and l�ked �t very much �ts sound qual�ty very good but th�nk �t comes from my bose tr�pod headphones :)  

+ Battery life is great, you really don't need to worry about charging this player. Menues are pretty easy to work with but the fact that there's no search option can sometimes make it somehow cumbersome to work with, try making playlists so you can find things easily.  

- very pool quality. actually i want to return this product. i dont know how to do that.  This is worst product from sony. I never expected this from sony.  I spent around $80+ for this product. that is my hard earn money.  

+ It's awesome! I really really enjoy it. It is small, download is easy, setup is easy, sound quality is great and the FM is good.  The only (small) drawback is switching between the FM and MP3. The buttons are really small and makes it hard to switch between different functions.    

+ Pros: Slick Design. FM Tuner Fits in the pocket  Shuffle option.  Cons: Headphones - had to immediately buy new headphones cuz the length of the earphone that came with the product were uneven.  Charges thru computer. Overly priced.     

+ battery life is great , and the SD card extention is nice you can add a 2GB card no problem.  

+ it was good but it wasnt quite built to specs as in the screen fades out every once in a while n stuff  

+ Very happy with the product so far and it looks like a new MP3 player. I am pleased with your service.  

+ This MP3 player is basically the best you can get the only problem I had was when I droped it and the volume wheel got messed up but other than that it's the best ever!  

- This item's USB device was not recognized by Windows.   

+ My wife uses her Rio Carbon all the time and she loves it.                                                     B. Holmes  

+ This is a great MP3 player.  I love that it is so small and simple.  I wish that they were more readily availiable.  I also love that it is rechargeable and I'm not running through batteries like crazy.  

- electrical short kills cheap-med quality head phones!  i lost four before i figure out the problem. and no, it was not just one player. i returned it and got a new one, and it did the same thing. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 because it records radio very well.DO NOT BUY!  

- As most who bought this one knows the battery door did indeed break on my sons. It skips and freezes really bad. He still uses it but I do not think it would hurt his feelings if it got stolen at school! lol  

+ Nice memory Hard to push some buttons Tons of functionality (FM radio, FM radio record, heart rate monitor, etc.)   

+ This player is nice it works very easy with my computer.  It was a little tricky to figure out all of the controls and my fat ape-like hands have trouble using it.  However, it is the right player for me and it seems very durable.  Batteries last forever.  have fun  

+ Bought this for my 15 year old.  He really likes it and it was reasonably priced.  Haven't had any problems with the unit.  

+ Had a problem with the device and and to return it. I no time I recieved correspondence from them and told me how to return the item. I received a brand new one and it returned to old one free of cost. The new item now works great. Thank you very much for your excellent service and product.  

+ Bought this for my husband, he loves it; it works great, looks great, nice small size, highly recommend!  

+ this player plays good but controls are hard to use it takes time to get use to them  

- there are better mp3 players, don't believe the hype. Often the OS freezes causing my battery to drain and requiring me to visit the apple store for repairs.  

+ I have been skeptic about ipod until I decided to buy  this one, although the video is now available I went for  this photo model anf I find it useful to organize your music and take it every where you need it!  

+ With the capacity to hold 5,000 songs or 20,000 photos, or any combination of the two, I don't know if I will ever be able to use all the memory I have available to me.  

+ Thank you for the great product and timely shipping. Great business and very responsive.  

+ excellent product, only had it for a couple of days tough (Ipod Video released and had to get one :p )  

+ It's very handy and easy to use, the quality of the sound is awesome.  

+ Honest came very fast. Has alot of space. Perfect no damage in good condition.  

+ The nano is in beat up condition but it is USED. Very fast shipping and I couldn't have asked for a smoother transaction. Thanks.  

+ I had a rio, this is soooo much better, much easier to use and sounds great. I highly recommend it.  

+ As a senior citizen I may be the oldest person to have purchased this Ipod. I love it for walking and listen to workout and dance music as I walk. It's easy to download the music from my Imac. And its so easy to use. All I can say is "cool"    

- Save your money. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it quit working 3 weeks later. First it started turning off for no reason, we changed the batteries, no better. Now it won't turn on and stay on for longer than 2 seconds. What a piece of crap!!!!!!!! Zero stars.  

+ pro  1. easy to use 2. support lots of languages 3. light and handy  con  1. need to get a better headphone for better sound 2. need to get closer for recording   

+ Creative makes a durable and trustworthy line of MP3 players. This thing accidentally made its way into my washing machine and it still works just like new! No worries here. Customer service is great, the warranty is great, and this product is very easy to use. I highly recommend it.  

+ Simple to use, no bells and whistles, and just the right price for someone like me when I walk.  The earbuds, however, are too large and they hurt and fall out.  I had to replace them.  

+ I bought this about 2 months ago and its a really good deal. It is very easy to use and i was able to download music form my cds into it quickly. The battery last a long time and it has a good sound quality. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a good music player without paying a lot.  

- Bought for my wife and haven't seen it in along time.  Even my son doesn't want to mess with it.  

+ This is the first mp3 I have ever had and I am so glad I didn't buy the trendy 200 dollar ipod.  It is easy to load and remove songs.  There is an FM receivewr and mic recorder.  I have used it extensively while jogging and have not had a problem.  Small and unobtrusive.  

+ It rocks my world along with the radio stations.  It only proves to you that good things do come in small packages.  

+ Be careful when you open & close the battery lid, my son he is 12 and he broke that little thing on the lid on the first day he use it, luck it came with a plastic case, so it can still hold the lid. Other than that this is a great product.   

+ There is just one word to describe this product: amazing. I'm full satisfied with it. Just buy it with 1Mbytes (mine is 512kBytes). One last thing: the battery lasts forever.  

+ This is a great little player.  All of the songs are very clear sounding.  We couldn't use Napster though, it kept saying that it wasn't compatible.  The headphones aren't comfortable either, which is a minor thing.  My son has this player too, and he thinks it's great.  

+ I did not know enough able this item to have made this purchase.  It was a gift and the 13 yr old was thrilled.  BUT we had a really hard time setting it up.  It still isn't up and going.  

+ I purchased this MP3 player to use while working in the yard and around the house.  I love it and am considering upgrading.  I find it very easy to use and to organize the contents.  Even after sending it through the washer and dryer, it continues to work wonderfully.    

+ This is a great MP3 player for beginner.  My 10 year old son loves it and has somehow managed to not loose or destroyed it!  

+ Works just like you would want a tiny MP3 player to work.  Very well laid out unit.  I am very happy!  

+ I really enjoy this product.  Much cheaper than Ipod, very happy.  Great size, I like that you can use windows explorer to copy albums to the device.  

- Please read J. Song "Over26"'s review below.  The same thing happend to my player.  It just stopped working after a couple months.  I tossed it out and got a 2GB SanDisk.  Don't buy this player.  

- Bought this one a few months ago. Soon after started having problems, trying to add songs to the hard drive, it says that the HD is full, even though I only have 1 song on the HD. THen it just completely shut off and I cant turn it on now. Piece of junk, dont buy this!!  

- Best price is a come on.  Standard bate and switch   Lowest price is no longer available BUT we can get you one at the highest price.      Not my idea of a way to do business.   But then each his own.  I will not be shopping here.     

- This computer is one of the worst items I've ever had (I took it back in the first week of using it)  It has a horrible screen  AIM doesnt work at all  Internet Browser is soooooooooooooo slow  DON'T BUY IT!  

+ This little gizmo is pretty great for the price. It's a little hard to access the files and repeat, play and what not, but all in all it's a great little MP3.  

- This product did not work from the beginning and I sent it back and bought my son and husband Sandisk MP3 players and they found them very easy to use and I plan on buying another one for my other son.   

+ One of the most useful items Creative has ever produced.  I have two - get one and you'll be happy with it.  Get some rechargeable AAA batts and you'll be even happier!  

+ I bought it for my dad and I haven't heard any complaints. So I guess everything is working ok. But those head phones are huge!!   

+ Excellent little player. Easy to transfer songs or even data and pics. Great sound. Very small and light weight. FM tuner is great. I'm glad I picked this one.   

+ Why WhY WHY do companies always discontinue their bombproof, proven and reliable products in favor of the latest, greatest and inherantly buggy?  Stupid move, Creative.  This player is phenomonal.  The Zen Stone Plus - it's presumed replacement - isn't even close.  Sigh.   

+ I was so happy with my Creative Zen Nano that I bought one as a gift.  I love the color choice and the sound is great.  Love the pause button. It came with a protective case that attaches to the arm band.  You do not need to buy one!!  Amazon delivered it in 2 days!  

+ this is a nifty very small musical device that I use when exercising.  its great - holds all the songs I can listen to and is so portable.  I really like it  

+ this is a great little mp3 player for our kids to begin learning how to take care of such items!!!  They are thrilled!  It does work with a mac computer even though it says it does not!  great sound and easy to use.  

+ I really like this MP3 player overall.  It doesn't hold a lot for those that want to puit multiple albums on their player but for me it was plenty.  It does seem a little confusing to operate but I am getting the hang of it.  

- ive had this MP3 play for about a year. in the begining it was ok for the price but since then the sound on it has been completely shot, the battery door has broken twice and gotten lost, and it can now be split in half. only suggested for short term use.  

+ Clear sound and easy to load.  The small size makes it easy to place anywhere while you are working out and stuff.  The screen is a bit hard to see sometimes but the size makes up for it.  

+ My item came quickly and was just as described.  My daughter loves it.  the only thing she doesn't care for are the big ear plugs---wished they were smaller to fit in her ears.  Other than that, she really likes it.  It was easy to load music on, etc.    

+ I love this player!  I have had no issues with it whatsoever.  It is very easy to use and to program.  I will be buying more items from Creative Zen in the very near future!  

+ This is the greatest mp3 player out there.  my son has an ipod and what a pain to put music onto......this creative you can just click and drag....i never even installed the software.  I love it!!!!  

+ It is worth the purchase if you can get it for a good deal. Arm band is not very good.  

+ Recvd our package on time, good condition. My daughter loves it and both Husband and son want one for themselves.  

+ This player/recorder, which was purchased for my wife, works exactly as advertised.  My old player is starting to die, so I will probably buy another one of these units.  

+ As many I did have some trouble getting my device to work, but althought I did spent good time in the attempt, I reset the device sometimes and learnt that there are some files that will block the iriver. It is awesome.    

+ I have had this product for about a month now and it been excellent so far. the battery life is very good...only slightly lower than that advertised...all in all, very happy to have bought it.  

+ This divice freeses every now and then, it's not worth returning so i will just deal with it.  

+ I really like the product, its very simple and nice to use. Comes with everything you need to use it, no buying extra things. I love the color screen and the radio, and even the Text reader is good keeping work out routines.  You can't go wrong with it.  

+ The portable MP3 meets all my requirements, such as awesome quality recording , large capacity, radio. I love it and bought extra one as a birthday gift to my friend.  

- After a year, the Lifedrive froze while starting up.  I tried resetting, including several hard resets, which the unit would never complete.  A call to Palm Tech Support did no good - they want me to send it back for repair (at my own expense, since it's past the warranty period).  

- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MX6L26/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-2267842-7747008">Palm Lifedrive Mobile Manager (Refurbished)</a>  The device I received would not take a charge.  I returned it, and my money was promptly refunded.  

- The price is not right, when a toshiba lap top, with 40GB, WIFI goes for 600 dollars paying just 100 less for a mere 4 GB is absurd.   

+ This is a great item, liek a mini tivo for on the go people, recoreds from tv, computer, dvd directly, awesome item.....  

+ This is a great system. I use it with my Amazon Unbox player and transfer digital videos.  Unbelieveable system, love it.  

+ Seems me that is an excellent product he which will be me of great utility.    

+ This is a great unit.  Got it to record movies for the kids.  Replace portable dvd units that last usually less than a year.  Great product.  Only bad thing is battery does not last as long as I would like for it but I no worse than anything else in this size.  

+ It is cool.  I use it for movies and the quality though not dvd quality is pretty good.  I like the thing and my hubby loves it.  I am satisfied.  

+ While a little expensive, we have been able to load it up with are kids favorite DVD's, and TV shows (and a few of our own) to make travel much more enjoyable.  It is very easy to use.  

+ Don't buy the adapter listed by amazon to go with this device.  It is sold by Adorama Camera and it is the wrong car lighter adapter.  I paid $7.95 for shipping along with $25.95 for the adapter.  

+ Great little machine except for the fact that it doesn't allow you to make daily or weekly recordings (think Simpsons every day). It only support some hokey interface with Yahoo calendar.  

- DON'T BUY ANY ARCHOS PRODUCT IS NO TECHNICAL SUPORT AND YOU NEEDS LAT CHRIS  

+ nano sounds gr8 i m very happy with the sound i hear compared to a old mp3 player i had and also very sleek and easy to use..  

+ This is a good MP3 device, great sound, easy to use. The only thing that was disappointing about it was the fact that although the product is advertised above as having an FM receiver in fact it does not (apparently the Creative Zen Nano Plus has a FM receiver.)  

+ The only downside is having to use a USB cord to copy files from my PC.  I own a muvo and you can just plug it in direct without a cord.  Apart from that minor issue, it's a great little player.  

+ Creative Zen Nano is inexpensive and great when compared to the IPOD which I feel is way overpriced.  Easy to use -I recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with an MP3 player  

+ Great buy for the price! Zen 1Gig has a great user interface for music and if you have a Windows Media player 10.0 or newer it syncs up very easy. Sound is better than my iPod clarity and bass response.  

- and also, doen't have radio FM ... I don't recomend.  

+ The MP3 player works fine but there is not FM radio in it. Beware of what they sell you. Other wise its ok.  

+ Wish it had more volume power ... STILL IT IS AN EXCELLENT GADGET ... the sound quality is DUVINE ...  

+ I'm a bike rider.  Now I can put in my ear buds, put my MP3 player in my pocket and ride for hours without changing tapes or cd's.  The sound quality is equal to sitting in the theater.  Thanks Creative.  

+ The screen is very small. But overall it was good for its price. Although I ordered a Zen Nano Plus, but Amazon sent me a NANO instead!!! which does not have a radio. Today I saw the iriver video player which was cool! it was really small and easy to use. I recommend that one instead.   

- I tried two of these, and took both back.  Maybe BestBuy just had a bad batch, but both were defective.  It would get stuck, sound like a broken record, and I couldn't advance or go back.  

+ Great gadget. Decent price. Lots of options. What else do you need?  

+ The iRiver MP3 player is not as fashion as iPod, but the C/P value is quite high. So far I really enjoy using this easy-operating and battery-saving mp3-player.  

+ the software is wonderful...u can download the music as easy as abc...the condition after months of hard use is still wonderful  

- the sound isn't that great, and it basically broke on me saying there is a file check error on it not allowing me to do anything with it.  Definitely just shell the money out for an Ipod for the quality product.  

+ The MP3 player was in mint condition, except there is a glitch where it shuts off randomly. But the same one I bought in the store did the same thing...  

+ PROS: The T30 makes a great voice recorder.  The mic and line-in sources both produce quality results. Both WMP and explorer modes are supported (with firmware change) CONS: WMP mode is slow with WMP11 Menu navigation takes some time to learn  

+ This mp3 players sound is great!! Its simple to use with w. media player. The only bad thing i can say about it is that it only holds 30-40 songs. I would suggest that you buy the one with bigger memory, spend the extra 20-30$ and get the bigger one. Thats all you need to know.  

+ I like this MP3 player. Its music quanlity is good and easy to use. But 128M is a little small. I should have bought the 256M version.  

+ The unit is OK but you need a microscope to read the small window & the icons. Makes changing modes difficult. Overall its worth the money.  

+ i have absolutely no complaints.  super easy to use and i'm a gadget-idiot!  great for running.  

- Sound quality poor.  Product was delivered late by a week.  

+ Bought it for my brother, and it is still alive, after so many bumps and drops and even soda spilled all over it. Sad it just had so little memory. As a toy its perfect!  

+ Just a quick warning: the description is misleading. While this player DOES support PlaysForSure DOWNLOADS, it does NOT support PlaysForSure subscription services like Yahoo Music...   

- I bought it and than I found one with little lcd 512 for the same price, so I recomend you serch for better price.  

+ Very Durable, simple to use and good battery duration, ideal for running.  

+ My product was recieved in a timely manner and was in GREAT condition.  It was everything it was described to be. Easy to use and quite compact.  

+ But works well once you figure it out.  Does anyone know how to turn this off without taking the battery out?  I just ordered two and the poorly written manual indicates to "hold the play button down for seconds."  I held it for 5 seconds, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc....nothing turned them off!  Help!   

- Great price but very hard to use, you can spend 15 minutes just trying to escape the menu. Be nice to have better volume control.  

- This product was a Christmas gift for my nephew.  He didn't get to keep it because it said on the packaging that it contains a chemical that causes birth defects.  I felt really bad that he didn't get to enjoy the MP3 Player.   

+ I got this for my husband for Christmas and he uses it everyday.  It works great.  It may not be as fancy as some of the more expensive ones, but it certainly is worth the money!  

+ This is the ipod ever and I love it but apple has missed one of the most important add on the FM RADIO maybe they could put Satellite but just radio would be fine.   

+ I own this Ipod Video and I love it a lot! Good quailty, and very descent, but if you do not put it in a case,it scrachtes a lot  

+ My order was upgraded to 80 gig, becaude the company did not have the 3ogig in stock. This upgrade was made at no additional cost. GREAT!!!!!  

+ I love this iPod sooooo much. I bought it almost a year ago, and it's amazing. never broke once. best iPod ever!  

+ My iPod definitely lived up to the hype.  I love it.  I thought watching videos on it would be foolish because of the small screen, but the truth is the video is crystal clear and I had no problems whatsoever watching TV shows like "Lost," "Desperate Housewives," or "30 Rock" on it.  

+ The ipod was cafefully packaged as promised. I recieved this before Christmas, which was a great time saver for me.  

+ everything is working till now. i have it for more than 2 years, using it everyday... for listening music, watching some videos and like a super pen drive and the battery still good! i have a 30gb one and my mom has the 60gb. they are really good!  

+ My husband is digging his video IPOD. He has pics of the grandkids on it and can share them at the gym while he works out...  

- First unit stopped working within first year. Even the replacement unit stopped working in 3 months.  Apple will not cover second unit failure in warranty.  Apple still have a serious reliability problem in my experience.  

+ Enough said.  I was a long time hold out, but I'm so glad that I gave in.  Great for travel and home.  

+ My husband got this for me for my birthday and I have used it non-stop ever since.  It crashed several times, no one knows why, and I took it to the local Apple store and they replaced it for free. Great product and great price  

+ It's nice... gives me options with plenty of disk space... I like to store a lot of pics... it's nice when you're on the go... also hooks up to my HDTV... I'm pretty happy with my iPod and would definitely recommend one to anyone....  

+ Been using it for a year now and never had any problems, battery life is excellent, but i think i bought too much of a capacity have used only 27GB max ;)...  My best buy so far!  

- I could not use it, the product I received was defective.  Item seems like returned item, I ordered for a new Item. It doesnt  look like original packing.  Navigation key up arrow is not working. I had to return it on the same day I received the item.   

+ I very much like this product because battery life is good, very easy to transfer songs and easy to navigate.  

+ hi i am 19 and i got this mp3 a gift from the us and its really cool and its soo good and you can record any thing on the radio music and many on the radio to record so this is the  #1 player best choice   

+ This is a great item only bad parts are that it expensive and i like ones that are not like a stick. The sound is good. I lost mine it was outside in the rain for weeks. The computer still read the memory from my computer but it woudnt turn on. Overall its great buy it  

+ Having an USB recharge is wonderful - no batteries to replace regularly.  Can easily switch modes, and it will remember reliably what your last setting was for.  You will love this little gem and 512 mb is more music that you really need to carry around.  

+ Has everything except viewing pictures~  

- Happy with the service but the product has been giving us problems. It has problems finding the computer and doesn't work half the time.  

+ This is the best Portable Video Recorder!  Easy to navagate, easy to transfer files.  My only problem is not being able to buy another.  

+ I bought it because I have an Alienware computer and have been very happy with it, this has been a good player but not on the same level as their computers.  It playes MP3s, it has been durable, will it change the world or set the bar... no, but it was fair price.  

+ I bought this player a few months ago. I have really enjoyed how simple it is to use.  As others have noted, the sound is amazing!  The earbuds are also terrific. It's very small and light.  Great to work out with.  Not to mention the cool Alienware design.  I love it!  

+ I cannot record any music to the player, because my computer isnot reconizing it.  Therefore I cannot use it.  

+ it goes thru batteries like mad. Get about 4 hours per, maybe...  

+ people thunk its bad but its not its a good mp3 from a respected comuter company and it sounds great  

+ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AZ00EQ/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-3327402-5617633">Sony NW-E305 Walkman Bean 512 MB MP3 Player White</a>  The product is excellent!!! I'm fascinated whith it. I recommed to those who likes ear clear music and is easy to operate.  

- Bought for great price and radio worked well.  Then product quit turning on.  Even if it isn't broken, you must install large software package to your computer.  Took forever to import my songs onto special software and convert to ATRAC.  Software is unstable with enhanced CDs.  

+ Great quality product, great sound and excellent design. I'm a little concerned about the sliding cover for the usb connector though. I guess it's not such a great deal! :D     

- This MP3 player is trash. The battery dies every other day. Half the time it shuts off for no reason. Can not get the voice recorder to even work. It holds the songs and it sounds great when it actually works.  

+ yes a little cheap feel you know how the battery cover doesnt stay on cheap electronics. makes music awesome display great options. Anyone giving this a bad review should go buy a $200 dollar ipod and let the rest of us enjoy these for next to nothing (25$) wont find a better one.  

+ This is by far the best deal for mp3/flash drives on the market. Great sound, and when they say 1GB they mean it. Also, Mach Speed is a great company. I cracked the face of the display and they sent me a new face plate free of charge. Customer service and tech support are A+.  

+ [[ASIN:B000B5SLSM Machspeed Trio 1 GB MP3 Player Voice Recorder Thumb Drive)] A big improvement over earlier release I listen to mp3 books.  You can stop and start back up exactly where you stopped.  Previous models would start back up at beginning of mp3.  

+ Machspeed Trio produces great sound but selecting playmode is a bit cumbersome. Earphones are a bit short for anything active.  

+ machspeed trio 1 gb mp3 player also a 1gb flashdrive i have no complaints it works great. I recommend it  

+ seller was very professional in responding to my order keep me abreast of when my order was shipped. I would rate this one a 10. very fast service, item was in excellent condition,keep up the good work  

+ This product is easy to download music easy to operate for a great low price.  No un-necessary plugs and cords to keep up with and you can also store data.  

+ I like all, the color, the size is perfect, is easy tu use de controls, but the problem is the radio it dosen't works if you are in movemen.   

+ Small, powerful and long battery life...perfect disk space.  I can workout for over 2 hours without ever worrying about dead batteries or running out of music selections.  Buy this!  

+ Great item with great sound.  Very small and easily clips onto clothing while working out.  The headphones that came with it have very good sound, but were fragile (had to replace it after it fell apart).  Would definitely recommend this MP3!!!  

+ This is a fabulous little product.  I have an ipod which I use as my home stereo but, the Samsung is what I use for my portable music player as it is durable.  Whether I am jogging or in the car, I grab my Samsung.  Sleek, durable and &lt;$100, what more could you ask for!  

- ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS IT BROKE IN A MONTH<br>NOT MY FAULT AT ALL  

- Lightweight.  Easy to use.  And truly a piece of garbage.  I used it only three times (while running) before it went kablooey.  Waste of money (which I am now trying to get back).  Spend the cash.  Get a decent one.  NOT this one.  

+ I received this as a gift and am very happy with it. As far as not having a drag and drop feature . . . it's not a big deal. The software was very easy to use, even for a novice like me. I would recommend this player.  

+ The player was all I expected and then some.  The graphics are great!  It was shipped quickly and arrived sooner than expected.  

+ I really like this player.  It is so much better than my last one from Creative.  Easy menu choices once you get the hang of it. Very good sound and lots of good features.  I recommend it highly to anyone wanting a low price but better alternative to the Ipod units.    

+ This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I got one for my wife for the gym, and fell in love with it.  Very easy to use, nicely integrated software, allows me to totally control what's recorded.  Highly recommended.  

+ Works great.  My daughter loves it.  Easy to download and use.  

+ Before I bought me a Zune player. I had this little player for like a year and half. Its a great player. Sometimes I still use it for voice recording for my exams in college. Since the zune does not have a voice recorder. I recommend this one.  

+ Love it!!! Love the features!!! An excellent substitute for a video iPod for a much cheaper price!!!  

- the device itself is very nice and packs interesting features,. The accompanying instructions and software, I bet that the peoples who developped it were working out of their backyard. It's simply worth a shiiitttt.  

+ I have had this product for about 8 months now.  I have noticed a few bugs like once in awhile it turns on by itself but besides this the sound is amazing and the video quality is awesome. I am very happy with this product because it is a great video mp3 player for an even better price. ENJOY!!  

+ This is the best mp3 player EVER!!  the screen is pretty big and holds ALOT of music and videos...has too many options to mention....but for the money, its a great buy!  

+ I bought this for my sister and she loved it, as well as myself. I got mine months ago and still using it.  Functionallity is great, no problems at all; sound is good and FM reception is neat.  I highly recomend this product, small size and oveall features are awesome.   

+ Seriously better than the little ipods.  Little small on the storage, but HUGE on features. Motion of the ocean, man.  

+ My husband commutes on the train each day for 1/2 hour each way.  He loves this MP3 player.  It holds a lot of songs for only a fraction of the price of an IPod!  

+ I couldn't be more pleased with this item. I have downloaded several thousand songs from DVD to Computer to Archos. The process went very smoothly. The instructions in the booklet are a little lacking and it could be improved some but the product itself is excellent'  

+ you get what you pay for, its not the best but it works fine   

+ Priced right, works fine.  I'm not happy with the usb connection, it broke in the first week, so all of my music is on the 1 gig sd card I put in.  Battery lasts maybe 5 hours.  

+ I got this for my son for christmas and he loves it. he has had more fun with this mp3 player than any of his gifts.  

- I had a similiar experience as another reviewer with this item. I purchased this player for my wife for Christmas. The player worked very briefly, then it went blank. It never worked again and I returned it for a refund.  

+ I purchased 2 for my kids and they love them!  I would suggest buying them for adults as well as kids!  

+ this is a great product with a lot of great features and is way better than any i pod at least me and all my friends think so!!!  

+ I BROUGHT 2 ZEN V 1 GB PLAYERS, ONE FOR MYSELF AND THE OTHER FOR MY DAUGHTER.  WE BOTH LOVE THEM. THE SERVICE THROUGH AMAZON WAS GREAT.  

+ LOVE THIS, LOVE THIS, JUST WISH IT HAD A RADIO, ALMOST ALL THE FEATURES OF AN IPOD, BUT LESS MONEY!  

- as usual, it doesn't work with windows,please dont waste your money,i'm from mexico and my problem is worst because i cant get my money back,so you better try with another mp3 ,no CREATIVE.  

+ I've owned Ipods and several other mp3 players. This past Christmas, I received a Ipod Shuffle and one of these Zen mp3 players.  The Shuffle does not have a screen but for the money it sure works a lot easier.  Trying to work the Zen program to get the music on there was a pain in the keester.    

+ Researched, bought it, rockboxed it, love it.  Great sound, battery life is consistently 14hours which is a lot more than I can say for the i-pods i've had.  

+ Cool device does what I want it to do,but could have  higher resolution  on the screen.Great music player storage device.  

+ I haven't used the photo/video features, but it works fine as far as playing mp3s, recording audio, and tuning fm radio.  The biggest downside is the joystick, which sometimes skips to the next file when I'm just trying to fast forward a little in a podcast.  

- This item was returned to the manufacturer. It was great to look at and had wonderful sound. The graphics were really good but overall it's a poorly made unit. There's a lot better buys out there than this one.  

+ I've owned two of these players and other than the 1G storage, I would put them up against anything out there. The "street mode" boosts the output so that even the lowest volume files play with plenty of punch.  

+ Unfortunetaly, its only 1 geabyte but if it had a better memory, it would be better than the piece of **** that is the iPod Nano. Highly Recommended!  

+ I like this product very much but wanna make shure that is re-chargable like Dell DJ Ditty.   

+ It costs half as much as an average iPOD it hold twice as much as a average iPOD! How can I refuse.  

+ This is a nice product. The only problem is that when charged through your computer it takes forever to fully charge. Additionally, if you utilize the equalizer function, the battery runs down exceptionally quick. Despite those functions, the overall product has great features and a great sound!  

- i basicly agree with the previous review but mine had major problem static noise whenever i tried to record from my dvd shame picture looked good to bad sound did not match i sent mine back. be aware  

+ No problems here it does what it says it does and nothing more. I love it, only had it a week. (also own a lyra) It's has issues, but dont they all. For what you get you cant beat it.   

+ Pro:  watch divx movies, usb host to download photos from digital camera, sync with media player Con:  battery life so-so, interface is lousy, does not come with a real case  The 402 is pretty good if you can get it on the cheap.   

+ its just as i thought it would be and it seems flawless  

+ i do not have many things to say about this item, It is sooo cool... I just did not like the batery caause its not take so long but the stuff is really good.   

+ Lots of memory in a compact size and easy to navigate. Must connect to computer to delete unwanted items.  I'm listening to audio books with 1 hour tracks and it doesn't always go back to where I stopped when I turn it off, but for listening to music it's great.  

+ I love this player...it is replacing a previous one I lost.  I received the product in exactly the amount of time I was told.  It was in excellent condition containing everything the description said.  

+ I have had it for a couple of years, and it's still working.  The menu's start to slow down if you have alot (1500) of songs on it.  The battery life isn't that great (4-6 hours), and it somtimes forgets what time it is, granted i've dropped it a couple of times.  

- I bought this thing all the way from US and VPOST to send it all the way to me in Malaysia and found out that it doesn't work. It is really frustrating. Now I have to send to out local service centre to repair.  

+ Revolutionary product - The only negative is the software.  Although you won't use Windows Media Player to install the music, you must not have WMP version 11 (you can have v.10) on your computer to download music into the Shoqbox.  Versatility and sound is 5 star.  

- We have an H340 that is 3 months out of warranty.  When its internal battery stopped holding a charge we were told that we now had a "paperweight."  Don't trust this brand.  

+ get it right now ,, it was the best thing i ever owend ...and at a good price   

+ I was a little skeptical when i ordered but my u10 works flawlessly,sounds great,and the battery is awesome.If you're looking for an mp3 player with limited storage then this is the one.I have an ipod nano 1gb, i prefer the u10 in all categories.  

+ Good product.. Worth the money which I spent.. Good picture quality...  

+ A very beautiful piece with a very big and clear screen. good music clarity. Worth buying it.  

+ It is a powerful mp3, worth buying at that price. I really like it.  

+ This is a very good product, the video is good and so is the mp3 player, best feature is the fm radio incorporated in it. only thing missing is an additional slot of memory card, either a mini or micro sd card. would help due to the low amt of memory on it.  

+ This product was a Christmas gift for my 9 yr. old son.  He loves it.  It is very easy for him to use.  He shows me how to use it!  

+ WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used).  

+ Sandisk Sansa m230 512 MB MP3 player is the best value for your money. It records cd's downloaded onto your computer like all mp3's but you can load your downloaded music also! Excellant quality. I have one and I bought this one for my son.  

+ easy to use, good sound quality, good price, works w/Rhapsody, even has an FM tuner that works fine.  It's too small though - I lost it.  I'll probably buy another one and put it on my key ring.  

+ My son really deserved a nice mp3 player because he has been getting honor role all year. This one came with everything it needed to work and has a decent amount of storage too. This is a great value.  

- I have gotten two of these devices and both have locked up on me. There is no support online and no one can figure out how to reset it. Don't waste your money!  

+ For the price, this is a nice MP3 player for music.  However, I was very disappointed to find that it has no ability to bookmark audio files I download from my public library.  The service people say it can only bookmark *.aa (Audible)files.     

+ I really like the sound quality of this player.  Very easy to use and add songs. Received about 1 week ago and still on same battery.  My only problem is I can't create a playlist.  Followed instructions that came with player but nothing works.  Any ideas out there?  

+ I didn't know what to expect. This was easy to use and a good product for the price.   

+ I absolutely love this Sansa MP3 player.  It has all of the features I want and doesn't cost a lot of money.  It is easy to use and I love being able to listen to my music in a variety of different ways (i.e. by artist, genre, album, etc.)  Great product!!  

+ I think this is a nice mp3 player.  Not complicated, easy to use and have had no problems thus far. The ear phones tend to move out of place. I've had it for over 3 months.  

+ I bought this MP3 player for a friend of mine that is blind. It's simple to use and my friend loves the fact that it's small and has raised buttons that she can feel.   

+ The SanDisk Sansa m250 is a great, easy-to-use, and compact MP3 player.  It was also inexpensive.  My only complaint is that the plastic covering for the arm band is very cheap and difficult to use.   

+ Great product.  Very happy and I would recommend it.  The only thing I would change is the design shape and the fact that the battery has to be changed every 2 days if used constantly.  Worth the Money !!  

+ I lost my first one and had difficulty finding a replacement.  I find it easy to load, run, and much prefer inserting a AAA battery for 20 hrs. playtime to having to recharge.  Unfortunately Sansa, like so many others, has since revamped their players into IPod clones.  

+ Epson has admitted to me that all their storage devices have problems with loading WA cards e.g. Lexar 133x, Told to watch for a fix.  

+ So I can hear more music, news and listen to the play by plays from the ballgames. It would be nice if it does...   

+ i just got this after giving away my black video ipod that had wayyy to much space for me. all of my movies go on here still with come space left..... and is not too small, but small enough  i would recommend this ipod than any other!  PEACE!! -_-Y  

+ What you see in the ad is what I got.  I'm happy with the product, the delivery and the cost!  

+ The best yet for those that don't have to have a million songs to choose from at any one time! There is ipod and there is all the "wanna-be's"....  

+ Not much to say really about this item except that it was confusing adding songs and stuff to it.  I still dont understand  how to add some songs onto it and I have no clue how to add videos.  If this item would come with a manual, I think it would be much better.  

+ The best ipod ever! Great size, video resolution, sound! I completely recommended it! I got it like for a month and i think is great!  

+ Love my ipod... I use it in the car, up on the mountain snowboarding, and working out at the gym (have the nike+ sport kit).  One of the best investments ive ever made.  

+ Very nice..  It was given as a gift  but they loved it..  lots of room for mp3's and also can look at pics with a sd memory card.  nice product and very fast shipping.  thanks so much...  

+ I have not used the video yet, but the music section i good...great sound  

+ This is a nifty little unit with easy controls and superior sound quality.  My daughter has friends with IPODs and Sansas and this blows them away.  

+ This item was easy to use, I like simplicity. Although the battery does not last as long as the box claimed!  

+ Everything went exactly as promised.  The player arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.  It's a big improvement over a previous Creative player, better controls, smaller, more memory, easy to use.  I could not be happier.  An excellent experience.  

+ I purchased this product from Amazon...and am totally satisfied with it..the sound quality is excellent and also the styling is good.Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery and also the super saving delivery. Cheers.  

- This product jammed and broke down after the first use and repeatedly thereafter.  I was able to fix it a several times using my computer but on the fourth round it seems totally kaputt.  I would not recommend it to anyone.    

+ This is a very nice mp3 player, versatile, easy to use and small. The interfase is very easy to use, the only defect are the headphones.  

+ Dear Sirs, Hi,  I would like to have FM radio to this gadget........ I think that you need to do more for that......not only to the Plus....  Thanking E.Tsingas   

+ I bought this for my wife, after a friend reccommended the brand. I guess I should have bought a better model or a different brand.  

+ I got 2 of these for my two oldest, 9 and 12, and I'd say that for a first mp3 player it's good enough.  They both love it.  

+ I purchased this mp3 player Sunday and it's Tuesday and it's no longer working--I tried new batteries and everything so tomorrow I'm taking it back for another one to see if it will work--When it was working though it did play good--Well hope to have better luck on the next one....  

+ This device is a foolproff way to make your JPegs totally portable with excellent clarity. A perfect product, but battery life sucks and sound quality way behind an iPod.   

- I DONT LIKE THIS MP3 PLAYER BECAUSE I HAVE TO PUT A NEW BATTERY IN EVERY TIME I USE THE THING.   

- I would never buy this product.  Every time I go to use it I have to put in a new AAA battery.  I have spent as much money on batteries as I did on the player itself.  I have since purchased a different MP3 player!!  

+ Purchased for my 8 year old son.  The price was good and it works great.  Easy for him to use.  He doesn't like the earbuds that came with it, but other than that it's perfect for him.  

+ The Coby MP3 met all my expectations. I ended up giving it as a gift because my friend needed something easy to use while working out. I plan to replace it with the same item.  

+ The mp3 player is economical and my girls enjoy listening to their music on the mp3 player.   

- EMERGENCY DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK FREEZE ALL TIME COMPLICATE INTRUCTIONS THIS IS THE WORTH MP3 I EVER AND EVER BOUGTH ......................pLEASE DO NOT BUY  

+ I am very pleased with this item. I've purchased it for my step son who turned 13 and I happy to be able to share the music I grew up with him along side. It's very user friendly and shipping was right on time.    

+ Even though this MP3 isnt perfect, its good for the price. what other 5gb mp3 player can you get for $80? had some problems when syncing because its unclear how to do it, but the mp3 player portion of it is good.  

- IT is not that good as i expect from samsung products.  

+ I Like it a lot!  Great Price!  Had a little bit of confusion with directions!  But otherwise fine!  

- I purchased one and received it, it never worked right.  I received a replacement and have had the same problem.  I think this model is a waste of money unless they fix the bugs.  It just keeps saying you have to repair the disk with software that does not come with it.  

+ I DIDINT THINK I WOULD LOVE IT SO MUCH AT FIRST BUT ONCE I GOT IT AND ADDED MY MUSIC I FELL IN LOVE!!! IT HOLDS SO MANY SONGS GREAT IF TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES!!! GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE!!  

+ I highly recomend the YH-820mc to anyone It is easy to use and a great product.  

+ This thing is out of date and i cant even get it to be recognized by my computer.  Then the tech support from Samsung cant enen help me.   Once i got it to transfer songs it was alright but now i cant do it again so i really wish i hadnt bought it so thats how i feel about it.  

- I purchased this player and two days later it froze. I contacted Amazon for another as a replacment, again this one froze. I bought this for a gift an wasnt happy at all. Amazon did refund my money in a timley fashion. I just won't buy a remanufatured Samsung audio player due to the poor quality.  

+ HI! I am looking at this and the AV500. Does this record off all dvd's too? Straight from a cable or just tv?? Which has better sound if you have heard both? ANy other differences? Thanks  

+ Positive: Very good video and audio quality! Supports almost all video formats.  Negative: Accumulates dust under screen. Not always support .mpg. Doesn't support PDF.        

- This product was great until it started freezing all the time, even during recording. All this in less than one month after purchase.  

+ This Player is great. The folks at Creative, or third parties, should not lose the momentum and must start offering accesories for this Player.  

- I didn't receive the item, I don't think it was the seller's fault, it just didn't arrive.  

- Stoped working after 2 months. I only used the radio and liked the presets. However it now has a demon and when you plug in the head phones it turns off or does weird scanning. But it doesn't work. It also used a Battery every four hours or so I bought rechargables but it was to much of a hassle.  

- This product worked well for 5 workouts.  Then the buttons stopped working.  New batteries didn't help. Still, it was cheap and I understand the whole MP3 thing now.  I'll buy something better next.  

+ This is just what I need to take with me during my workout.  It holds just enough music to get me going.  When you want to change your songs its easy to do.  

+ Bought it for my son and though it doesn't have the information right on the face like he wanted, he is still pleased with it.  

+ For a budget mp3 player it isn't too bad a deal. Definately a no frills device, but if you want to use it for working out, as I did, you can't beat the value.  

+ This is a great product for the price it was. The best thing about this mp3 is the sound quality. I haven't had any trouble and transferring music is so easy.  

- I had it for about 3 months and it finally started skipping non stop so I got a new one but not the same brand. Dont drop it a lot and be careful where you put it  

+ I bought this for my husband so he could listen to tunes while mowing lawns.  It doesn't hold a lot, but enough for what he does.  It was easy to use.  He is pleased with it, and so am I.  

+ I love it.  It works very easy.  I just figured out how to use it and it did not take but few minutes.  Easy to use and lot of memory for my songs.  I found it at a great price.  I am very happy with this buy.  I will buy again from here.  Thanks for a great product.  

+ It's not easy to install the software. And it's too heavy to take to workout. I think I made a wrong choice.  

+ Great price for so much memory. Easy to set-up. Over 1,000 songs downloaded with more room to add more.  

- DO NOT BUY. All kinds of kinks, worst of all, COULD NOT LOAD NEW MUSIC AFTER 2 DAYS!!! The USB cord just stopped working. This was a big expense for me and a total disappointment.  

+ I am very pleased with the overall function of the unit now that I am able to use it. The BIG problem with this unit is the overwelming lack of information provided by the manufacturer concerning how to use the product.  

+ It's a pretty good product, and the price was much better than other mp3 players I've seen.  Slightly tempermental, but still a good buy and a good product  

+ To be honest the only problem I have with this product is the fact that it does not play video, but other than that i give it an easy 5 stars! easy to navigate, lots of personalisation options and cool features.  

+ If you use the WAV setting on recordings, this little unit is very nice as a podcast recorder.  

+ This little gadget delivers a big punch for very little money.  The sound is great and it is easy to load directly from your computer.  I am quite pleased with it.  It is very lightweight and easily carried around my neck (or anywhere).  

+ Cute, reliable, compact and easy to use.  The only thing I did not like is that it is not compatable with Napster.  

+ honestly I expected for the player to be below par for the price, but was delighted to discover I was incorrect. Definately one for the working class, otherwise I couldn't afford it.  

+ Wanted something inexpensive for the little one.  He loves listening to his own music and can run it without a problem.  

- The unit wouldn't support DRM, so any songs downloaded from the internet were not usable on the player.  Once we got some CD's burned and songs copied on it crashed and was never recoverable.  The voice recording feature also never worked like it said it would.  

- First one didn't work, got a replacement - both easy to put music on the device but the music will not play ... very clugy button setup and even the neighborhood tekky kid couldn't get the songs downloaded to play - don't buy this item!   

- This thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over.  We thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery didn't help.  Don't buy this item.  I am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here.  

+ It does take awhile to figure out how to actually use it BUT its well worth the effort.  I highly recommend it. Its inexpensive has excellent battery life.....  

+ It took me weeks to figure out how to use it.  I downloaded the disk that came with it, but it was of no help.  And I scoured the instructions that came with it with a fine tooth comb, but I still did not get directions for how to use it or how to get songs onto it.  

+ Great item for my kid for birthday present. I got it for them and they ended up showing me how to work, very simple. Great for what I spent, too.   

+ I spent some time researching affordable MP3 players for my youngest son(10). I kept coming back to this one. The ease of use, display screen and ear buds...this MP3 player is the complete package. I am very happy with this product!  

- Specs say 20 hours get maybe 2.  Then have to turn of batter life switch and back on.     

- Battery life is absolutely atrocious.  I have had the battery replaced twice, and still I have less than 2 hours battery life.  And when the battery drains, all music/photos stored on the internal hard drive are gone....have to reload from a PC.  Worst product I ever bought.  

+ The unit works to our expections.  It is very easy to use and the screen is fantastic.  The 30 GB capacity is more than enough and it works great with Windows Media Player.  Great sound as well.  We are very happy to own this unit instead of an Ipod.  

- I have had the same problems as many other users.  The Gigabeat worked OK for two months, with an occasional freeze up.  Now my computer can't recognize it and it erased all of the music that I put on it.  And the Toshiba Customer Service people are complete jerks and hung up on me.  

+ the only flaw i could think of with this is that you have to use windows media player to sync video... but, the audio can be added with drag and drop... i love it, best user interface out there  

- Great looking and easy to use, but when the unit came, it wouldn't play any of the songs, WMA or MP3. When I pushed the play button, the pause icon wouldn't go away. Didn't want to exchange it, returned it fast and easy.  

+ anyone else have this problem?  please help... i am using Windows Media Player...  

- I bought this a year ago and had some problems with it.  It was defective from the factory.  Trying to work with Sandisk customer support was not a positive experience.  I am about to throw it away and buy another brand.  

- I bought this as an IPOD alternative for Audible books .  It takes a long time to start and stop and does not return to where you left off in a book accurately.  Maddening.  I'd avoid this if you listen to audiobooks.  

+ I have now purchased as gifts 3 of the Zen V units. Great as a gift, especially with new low prices. I am a happy Zen M owner, but I'm tempted to buy one of these for myself.  

+ player seems to work great, locks up once in a while when you are trying to go through things too fast.  but it is not a problem.  

+ This portable XM radio/25 hours of saved music, etc. is great.  I listen to 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's music during the day.  My husband listens to his baseball games at night.  If you also get the car kit, you can use it in your car.  [...]  It is worth it! [...]  

- It's okay, but I didn't like having to record songs for playback. I really wanted to be mobile and still have the live radio.  

+ This XM / MP3 player is so versitale, it gives me the best of both worlds, able to record up to 50 hours of music, plus hours of MP3 songs.  I could'nt ask for a better combination.  Samsung put a great product together with the NeXus YP-X5Z.  

+ The Samsung Nexus 50 does exactly what it is suppose to do.  I have had no problems with the unit.  It is like having a vcr for your satellite.    

+ This XM radio is terrific - small & compact, but with lots of memory for recording my favorite music - and all at a great price.  Outstanding value!  

- The flash drive doesnt get detected at all. The customer service of CENTON doesnt respond. I wish i could get the replacement.  Thanks..  

+ Very good product for the price. The sound is not the best, but compense the price... Very Easy to use!!!  

- I bought three of these items and with in two weeks all three began to malfunction ,the fm radio function stopped working and the player kept switching on and off rendering it useless.The only funtion remained partially working is the flash drive memory option.    

- This is extremely hard to use and confusing. Mine came without instructions. I accidentally pressed the "hold" button and have never since managed to get it off hold.  

+ If your looking for a cheap mp3 player, this is a good choice. The built-in speakers are decent quality, and haven't broken yet, and ive had it for about a year or so. The only issue i can think of is that it has only 512mb of memory and doesn't hold a lot of music.  

- HDD Read error when opened the box. I searched the internet and found it hapened to many others (I made a mistake not searching about the prodcut before purchase). No resolution was suggested. I packed it back and shipped it for refund.  

+ i used to have a regular ipod nano but wen i got this i wuz amazed because u can have sweet colors including pink and it is harder to break. it is pretty much an ipod mini except smaller.  

+ I'm still amazed by the quality of the sound this little monster puts out, especially when I added Sony MDR-V700DJ Monitor Series Headphones that are available as one of the accessories. Whew! Only problem is now I don't want to read books anymore when I'm at the beach.   

+ I found this MP3 Player to be extremely easy to use and configure.  The case is scratch resistant and I liked the fact that you could remove the diplay and plug in directly to the player thus saving battery life.  

+ This was a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It is the greatest gift ever. I would definitely recommend this product to those who love to listen to music at all times.   

+ I gave the ipod to my daughter for christmas. She said she likes it but when she opened up it had a fairly nice size scratch on it.  

+ I haven't heard anything but great things from the young lady that got this for Christmas!  She loves it and takes it everywhere.  

+ I got one the first one i got it soon gave out . i shipped it back and they gave me a new one . and that one works very good.  

+ great product but they keep changing the design to sell more headphones. I want in ear lanyard headphones that are not honkin big but they are not available for the 2nd gen!  

- I have one of these. It worked fine for a few months, but then the on/off button started having problems. Sometimes I just can't turn it off. I will think twice before I buy an Apple product next time.  

+ I ordered this pink ipod nano for my neice for Christmas.  She loves it and the sound quality is great! I highly recommend this product!  

+ I've never owned one of these, it's so cool! I love this ipod! I'm not an expert, but I think it sounds great, it looks good (I got silver), holds a lot of music and it's small but substantial. The only problem is those earbuds, they really hurt my ears....  

+ The device itself is nice, but iTunes is not worth the hassle.  Find another mp3 player that has a more user friendly interface to manage what's on it.  The ipod comes with very little instructions and is not intuitive at all.  

- I have a diferent ipod previously and it is great.  I bought this one used and it was dead in 1 week.  I will not buy an ipod used again, it is not worth it.  The Nano in general is a good product, just not the one I got stuck with by buying used, you never know the abuse.  

- Slick little MP3 player, easy to use, but battery died if I went more than 48 hours without playing it.  This is my 6th MP3 player, and one of 4 I have in use, but I decided to rreturn it to the store.   

+ tried player and very happy with results.  would highly recommend this to others.  

- I'm not a careless teenager, but a 59 years old cautios and fastidious person. Still my iPod turned out to be rather short-lived. May be it's how it should be for a Made in China gadget.  

+ Product was shipped in a timely manner and arrived as promised.  Product was as advertised and worked properly.   

+ I waited for the 3rd gen nano to be released to purchase the 2nd gen(cheaper) and replace my 1st gen nano. Extremely small, great sound, and plenty of space for my music. Happy with purchase.  

+ The iPod is great! I had a 4 GB nano before this, and the 8 GB has so much more space! It works perfectly. I love it.  

+ This is a great product, holds lots of songs and I haven't had any problems!!  

- Unfortunately the battery would not hold a charge. But the retun service was excellent. No hassles and the refund was made immediately upon receipt of the returned Ipod. I would use this company again.  

+ The product arrived fast and in excellent condition. There was not a CD but rather an Apple website to download newest itunes version. It would not load on Windows 2000 but required XP and Apple referred us to tech support where we purchased item. Eventually I used another computer with XP.  

+ This is the best iPod yet. So small most earphones weigh more. No need to spend tons of money on cases and armbands because it clips anywhere. Perfect for the gym since most people dont need to pick and choose songs during a workout and you can rearrange songs on iTunes.   

+ This is the second iPod product in our house.  I wanted something small that I could leave plugged into my car's audio system.  As is customary with Apple, the new shuffle is made of high quality aluminum and easy to use.  The sound is great and the price can't be beat!  

+ I just got mine from Bestbuy its all you can expect from a 79$ no frills attached MP3 player that plays beautiful music with solid design and controls  

+ This is great for running when you dont want any extra weight.  Also great when you dont want to worry about messing with forward and backward play, just shuffle the songs you want and your good to go.  

+ This product is ok.  It is a good starter ipod for a kid.  Affordable. Quick shipping, good packaging.  Thanks  

+ I love my little green machine.  The battery last forever and its small enough to stick anywhere.  

+ Good things do come in small, pink little packages! Great sound quality when I play through my v-moda earbuds.  

+ I love this iPod, it looks beautiful and elegant, perfect for its purpose, reasonable price, easy to use.  

+ I have owned this, and it works really well.  Its nice to be able to watch videos and listen to music on the same player.  Well worth it, but not for 99,999.99 :D.    Enjoy  

- I can't understand how apple sell so much ipod video while they are so bad in front of an archos. Just look at the screen and you'll understand ! Archos is an hundred times better !  

+ The M:robe is easy to use, looks great, and holds over 1,500 songs. How anyone can complain about that for $200 I cannot understand. Sure the screen gets scratched but that's my fault for not buying a holder. Same thing happens with ipods. Unless you want to buy into Apple, I suggest you buy this.  

+ The only grip I had with this player was that it wasn't as loud as it's ipod rival...  That has all changed since Olympus recently released a new firmware upgrade that gives the mrobe player a much needed boost in sound.  Now I can say with confidence, this player rocks.  

+ I was very uncertain when I purchased a refurbished ipod.  But then I did some research and found that they are perfectly fine to purchased and have been fixed with brand new parts .  My ipod works great and arrived very quickly from this company. Packaging was great as well.  Well done!!!  

+ The ipod came in very good condition and came with everything needed.Also came quickly. Thankyou  

+ The first product shipped had a defective battery (wouldn't hold charge over 36 hours).  When I contacted Express Solutions they quickly replaced the first one with a functioning one.  Overall, I'm satisfied but not impressed.  

+ How can i begin to describe it?  THIS THING IS FRICKEN AWESOME!!!!!! i use it every single day in class and at home.  I have hundreds of songs movies and tv shows on it.    

+ I owned a Zen portable media center, and while the screen was bigger, it was not nearly as sharp as the Zune screen. With Zune, both my kids can watch it at once since the viewing angle is so wide. I'm glad I have one.  

+ Nice try ... it does the job but needs more work. The feel is very nice but the sharing is only good for three plays and then you must buy the song. It's screen is 320X240. Bla. I'll stay with the iPod for now.  

+ This was just what I was looking for. The Griffin AirClick did not have a passthru for a power connection. This does. The RF remote works as promised and this can function in place of a more expensive dock if your choose to use it that way. A great product at a fair price.  

+ It works as advertised.  It is especially useful when hiking, running or walking on cold days.  I usually keep the iPod buried under layers of clothing and the remote allows me control without digging out the iPod each time I want to skip ahead or adjust the volume.  

+ used it on a sportbike for a 10 day 3000 mile (rain too) trip. worked great, easy plug and go.  ipod stayed clean and dry. ijet did the dirty work. velcroed  it on the clutch master cyl. with room to spare. i loved it.  

+ With good quality MP3s or WMAs, this player sound like a good CD player.  I carry 8 CD quality albums in this player that's the size and weight of a Bic lighter.  Good FM, and live voice recording too.  I thought I would needed to upgrade the earbuds, but they are good too.  

+ Very happy with this product,  battery life could improve.  

+ Use this all the time for downloading and listening to books from the library.  Great for work, listening out in the yard, on walks etc. Downloading is easy. Sometimes have difficulty getting it to start at the same place where I last left off, but in the end can get there.   

- This is the one of the worst mp3 players because it's hard to have it connect to your computer and the software is terrible.  Also, it always freezes and the sound messes up on a regular basis.  Please do not buy this if you value your money at all.  I'm sorry I did.  

+ viejo, es de los mejores reproductores ke hay, inteligente, y la interfaz del programa es amistosisima, la verdad es muy inteligente, hasta ahora no le veo peros, ya le puse video, musica y fotos, no me arrepiento, sin duda, comprenlo, no se van a arrepentir !!!!  

+ Longer battery life, looks alot better, cheaper, has video capability, easy navigation, radio-need I say more? Ipod nano on the other hand.....has more assessories.  That's it.  Get the e250 instead of the nano.  You won't regret it.  

+ I've had mine for less than a week and already I know it's great way better than a nano. Part of the reason i love it is because with it i can buy cheap 10 cent mp3s not rip off itunes.   

+ Actually, haven't tested the MP3 yet, just bought it last weekend. This is a graduation gift to my son.  I thought the looks and price is quite reasonable to compare with the "hype" Ipod Nano.  Plus I find all the reviews on this product fair and right on the money.      

- When this unit works it is a great idea. Mine froze up on me and I was forced to return it.   

- For a device with practically no moving parts, there is no excuse for it to freeze after a week of ownership, and barely an hour of use. If it would work, it could be just about my ideal mp3 setup. We'll see what happens if I am able to get it replaced...  

+ I am enjoying mine so far.  I have a question for you folks out there.  Has anyone found an armband that works for this guy?  I use it when jogging and its annoying to keep it in my hand or pocket.  

- This is awful like within 2 weeks it started to develop problems now its just frozen on me its bad  

+ Pros: Good flash memory space, nice color screen, decent funtionality, great price!  Cons: Needs an armband!, dim/disable backlight needed to extend battery life.  

+ The photos of this product are misleading.  This product is described as "ultra-thin", however it's actually almost an inch thick.  That makes it nearly three times thicker than an ipod nano.  The photos don't show the rear, which has a rounded shape to accomodate the AAA battery.  

- I have had this MP3 player for about 4 months. I need to replace the USB transfer cable. I cannot find a source for this cable....The MP3 player is useless without the cable. How could SanDisk sell this item with replacement parts?  

+ I have had this MP3 player for 1 week it works good and very easy to use.  Battery life is great, and it is easy to navigate.  This is my 2nd Sandisk MP3 player, I purchased this one because the other was only 512mb.  

+ Don't listen to what these other bone heads say!  This MP3 Player is perfectly fine!  If your looking for a cheap reliable MP3 Player, this is the one for you!  I wouldn't buy anything else!  SurvivalMan  

+ I bought this for my hubby so he could listen to decent music on the plane and when he runs.  The sound is amazing, it could be a little louder but it's still crystal clear.  

- I bought 2 of this for Christmas one worked for 33days the other one never did. Got refund on one, the other can't because warranty expires in 30 day, and player got dead on the 33rd day.  Bottom lines, crappy player, don't buy it!!   

+ This is a great mp3 player to start out with.  It's just enough for me anyway, i don't have alot of music to put on an mp3 player so this is great.    It's good on batteries and works great.  The buttons are touchy but other then that it's a great little mp3 player  

+ I bought this mp3 player for my son. It seems to be a pretty good buy.  It just needs to have some kind of way to attach to something.  Other then that I would say that it's a good buy for the price.  

- Well, I recieved the product promptly, but the compartment for the battery was not easy to figure out how to get off. THen, I have two of them for both of my kids.  One of them constantly shorts out and the other one occasionally does so.  It has been very frustrating for me and my boys.  

- The mp3 player I purchased work perfect for three weeks, since then every time it is touched more moved it shuts itself off. When you turn it back on, it goes back to the song that was playing when you first turned it on. It was never dropped or mishandled, so this purchase was very dissapointing.  

+ This is a nice little inexpensive mp3 player.  It holds quite a few songs and is easy to use.  There are not a lot of options, but is a good starter mp3 player or for a younger music fan.  I was happy with what I got, but will eventually upgrade, passing this one on to my kids.  

- The Mp3 only worked 3 days. After the third day I ignite it and it does not do anything, stays as in stanby without possibility of doing nothing.    

+ This mp3 has worked out great for my son.  He just wants to listen to "his" music.  With this mp3 he can do that without interrupting the rest of the family.  The player is not so good if you want to find one specific song or artist to play.  

- This isn't worth the money. Save your pennies for a few more weeks & buy a different MP3 player. This is little more than a toy included in a cereal box.  

+ This is a very handy and easy to use tool. Just plug it directly to you USB port and download, erase, and reset, whatever you want.   The battery is a AAA that is easy to find and extremely easy to replace.   It has no belt clip but a small cell phone holder from the dollar store works fine.   

+ I got one and installed the programs. Since then all I got was errors and requests for updates. I had 600 songs and it deleted 420 of them ! In the end I sold it and stuck to my Sony discplayer with a 1gb disc. No problems - great sound.  

+ i bought this with concen but i love it everything u can think of an ipod and more! but u can't view all songs all songs by artists unlike ipod..screan maybe diffucult to see in the see ....the bottom line this is the best mp3 player ,i recomend it better that any of the ipods!!!!!!  

+ Good MP3 player once you get the hang of running the controls.  Would recommend putting the sensitivity controls on the LEAST sensitive stting or you are always going past where you wanna be. Has done a very good job for me.  

- My 14 year old son received this for xmas last year and by the summer it was broken, he really takes good care of his things so we were very disapointed. this year he's getting an ipod, my husband and I are both ipod users and after this experience I think we will remain loyal to ipod.    

+ For the money and for it's size, this is a good value. I use it primarily hooked up to my car radio and I can listen either to music or to the spoken word. I was impressed with the sound quality, too.   

+ The screen is very nice and easy to view, even in bright sunlight. I was able to load songs with no trouble, and sound quality is pretty good. Only negative is that you must use a USB hookup to charge it.  

- IT SO CHEAP IN QUALITY ALMOST SEEMS LIKE A TOY. THIS ITEMS SHOULD BE IN THE PRICE RANGE OF $15.  

+ I really enjoy this mp3 player and the radio. The only thing that is not very convenient is that the battery dies fast, so i have to charge it every day. It sounds great. The shipping and delivery was fast.  

+ this is an awesome product, very easy to use, very easy to set up. easy to download music to and easy to charge the battery with usb connection. would recommend this product to anyone looking for an mp3 player  

+ I have used this MP3 player since August and I love it.  Small, lightweight and so easy to use.  I've recommended it to my friends.  Great product for the money.  

+ The click system is fun and easy to use. The player itself is nice and compact, and thin. The sound and movie quality are top notch. The packaging itself shows the effort that went into the product. It looks great and oozes a lot of wows from others. Overall great product.  

+ I've had my IRiver Clix for about 2 weeks now and it's probably the best thing since the internet. User Friendly, portable, so small you can put it in your pocket. Must have - clix cradle which allows you to listen to your clix without headphones.  

+ Nice MP3 player with many features.  Easy to use.  Only complaint is the volume doesn't go loud enough.   DIED AFTER 3 MONTHS!!  

+ I did a lot of research into the different MP3 players before selecting this one almost a year ago. I wanted one that was small, had approximately 1-2 gigs of space and would be easy to use. It exceeded my expectations. I wouldn't trade it for a different mp3 player.  

+ it is great for listening rescoreded articles, public talk, music  and store some most needed files. it is well designed easy to carry. i love it.  

+ GREAT PRODUCT  

- large storage volume: 2 GB, mp3 player sound quality is ok, but the voice recording sound is mixing lots of noise, it is not a good voice recorder, change battery very 3 hours, it is not a good power efficient player.  

- Cheap MP3 player, have had trouble with it on several occasion and currently it is not working again.  When it does work, the music quality is good that's why it gets 2 stars but I would suggest saving yourself the hassles and look elsewhere.  

- I received this item in a very timely manner, although when I opened it up the face part where the songs would display has been damaged. looks like it might have been heat damage of some sort, the display will not work.  

+ this is a good player, if the price wil go a little down I think will be very good.  

+ This product is very good for the price. Does just what it is suppose to do. Wouls buy it again!  

+ This is great, especially when I am walking.  I love listening to the music I want.  

- it does not work. I spent 20 maybe 30 hours and no luck. the guy from costumer service had no idea either. If you pay $5 for this mp3 that is $5 too much.  The worst thing I've ever got  

+ the user-inferface is a bit difficult to get the hang of, but overall works as advertised  

- plz dont take this product....bcoz it has no sign of USB at all....when u connect it to the system....it shows no sign that it is connected...  

- not easy to navigate. can't choose a song. basic.  

+ This mp3 has a good sound and design. The quality of the product is perfact with a sealed package. Also, shipping was pretty fast.   There are some cons, such as the program is quite difficalt to use and is limited.   

- I bought this today and I am returning it tomorrow.  It claims to be an MP3 player, but you can not load mp3's onto it.  You must put Sonicstage on your PC, transfer all of your mp3's to that program, and then convert all of those files to ATRAC (?) format on the player.  This thing is horrible.  

- This is a very light and compact mp3 player. Unfortunately, it does not play mp3s! You need to use Sony's proprietory software to convert your mp3s into another music format before being able to play them.  

+ i like this better than the i-p's and it works great,  many features and long battery life, gets recharged from the usb connection on your computer.   

+ Great mp3 player. I guess not everybody will appreciate one-line display, however, I knew what I was getting and it is absolutely awesome. I play with Koss Porta Pro and the sound is great, and the design and controls are excellent. Thumbs up.  

+ If you want to buy a MP3 Player don't waste money in unknow marks. Buy Sony and everything goes rigth. I wasted 60 bucks in a MP3 Sankey an its never works.  

- The title says it all, cheap headphones, wimp of a battery, difficulty in loading and actual use, and average sound makes this puppy a bad investment.  

- You need to install a sony software to upload and dowload music. I didn't liked it.   

+ Amazing player. The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of its accompanying software. It's a bit cumbersome to use. But the player itself is a piece of beauty. Looks great, plays great.  

+ this item is working beautiful and working well. i have no problems wid it what so ever. Infact it is the best item i have ever ordered on this sight.  

+ The walkman works great.  I had a bit of a rocky start with the software that loads music and some compatibility issues w/ the different types of wma files downloaded from napster.  

+ The player works great.  It was well designed as an exercise player.  I like the design of the ear buds.  Software is a bit of a pain.  

+ Don't fall for the free iPod scams in the fake "reviews" posted here. It's spammers harvesting email addresses for their ridiculous products.  Think about it for a moment. How can somebody afford to give away $250+ gadgets just for signing up for some trial offers? Answer: they can't!  

+ This thing is the coolest thing ever because even though it's 500 more songs than the first mini, it still makes a diffrence!  It might be bit heavier and a bit bigger than the first, but it's still, well, mini!  This is the second best thing I own.  

+ The NW-S203F is a very good music player with good sound quality and very comfortable to wear when exercising.  I really feel it was a very good buy and would recommend it.  

+ Good things do come in small, pink little packages! Great sound quality when I play through my v-moda earbuds.  

+ This is not a review, just a heads up to let everyone know a new 2GB Shuffle is coming out near Mid-March of 2008, at a cost of about $70.  You will get 1GB extra for only $20 more.    

+ I bought this ipod for me and my aunt we loved it cause perfect for gym use. YOu can clip it and go.. !!  

+ This is my first iPod and I am enjoying the heck out of it!  It's easy - easy - easy.   Next purchase will be to upgrade the ear buds for a bit more comfort.  Sound is very good.  Having a soundtrack for daily life...priceless.  

+ Great for what it is. No screen, so you have to arrange things the way you want them before you upload. It bookmarks tracks where you left off, which is perfect for listening to podcasts or books on tape, which is what I use it for. Great gadget for the price.  

+ the delivery was prompt and the ipod shuffle is real easy to use I just hope that it won't be ko just after the warranty is over like all my previous ipods !  

+ This product has been a great buy for me.  I use it for long distance running.  It's tiny, it clips on to anything (and doesn't fall off), it's got great sound quality and it's easy to use.  So far I've had absolutely no problems with it.    

- Quit working after only 4 months!  While it comes with a 1-year warranty, you have to pay $30 shipping to get a replacement.  Four months is a pathetically short lifespan!  

+ Wanted to gift my younger sister.  I felt every penny worth after seeing the joy on her face.  She uses it and what more should i say , its an apple product .  Thank you Amazon !   

+ i love this ipod since its so easy to carry and change my songs while im walking, on the bus or doing whatever i am doing. im almost always listening to my favorite songs.  

+ I am very satisfied with my purchase. I wanted something small, which would fit my pocket, at the same time something elegant and with long battery span. It is very easy to operate because of different sorting options (type of music, artist, album). This mp3 player meets all my requirements.  

+ Good product. I think it's a much better buy than the IPod, because these competeing products do a lot to make up for the fact that they aren't mac. It is strong built, more capacity for the price, really easy to use. Perfect for anyone who wants an MP3 and not just an "IPod".  

- This player is WAY too prone to static electricity.  It crashed/rebooted EVERY TIME I touched it.  I returned it for a refund.  

+ Good sized product, easy to use and works straight out of the box. Great for storing pictures, videos, music etc... and as a media player works well. great alternative to the more expensive 'fruit' machines.     

+ Archos is a good product however the poor battery life and difficultly of recording video could improve.  

+ While this was a gift. I have to say this device is a great gadget to have... I have been able to subscribe to iTunes and convert all my purchased songs to mp3 playable formats for the Archos.... this toy is a head turner when you are flying.  

+ Nice screen and video and music capabilities.  Web browser is slow. Need larger selection and variety of hardware and software accessories, e.g. cases, screen protectors, stands, web browsers, cables, chargers, etc.  

- dented and sold as new.I didnt notice that dent on the left side of the product until recently.   

+ gift for my techie husband... perfect media storage/player.  I use it to store mp3's, vidoes and pics.  The docking station makes it perfect for recording television shows and watching them on the go or at the gym.  great sound and picture quality.  get it now!  

- The device is fine, but I'm about to get a 2nd RMA. These things are prone to failure.  

- The archos unit is very hard to operate and tech ser are not very helpful when you need them.  

+ This product is little bulky but has a bigger screen than a ipod It doesn't have Wi-Fi nor a browser so you cannot connect to the web which is necessary for downloading online content. We need a optional DVR station to connect and record TV programs.   

+ It is an excellent product but...when I wanted to see all the videos that I had, it takes the surprise to me that does not allow to see all the formats of video, and that I need to buy a called software CINEMA. It is not fear  

- Unfortunately I when I put searched "pocketdish" on the Amazon website, this product came up leading me to believe that this was compatible with my dishnetwork DVR -- it is not.  I am sure it is a great product, but not at all what I was looking for.  

+ An excellent product at a great price.  What could be better?  My teenage son was thrilled to receive this as a birthday gift.  He couldn't be happier.  

+ I took this device on a trip to France and used it to back up 3 cameras - 1 with an SD card, 1 with an SDHC card and 1 with a memory stick card. All told, I backed up about 10GB of images without a problem with plenty of battery power left. The ESP worked flawlessly.   

+ This product is really versatile for my needs. I can listen to music, watch videos, and most importantly store my photos while on the go!!  

+ Perfect for travel/storage when a laptop is too much. Handles my digital RAW photos easily.  

+ I have had the Wolverine ESP80 for about a month now. It is well made, very reliable and based on other similar units the best value I could find. It is compact enough to fit in my camera bag. I would recommend this unit.   

+ Forget iPods.  This little beauty plays music, movies, podcasts, photos and syncs with MS Outlook for much less $$$.  

+ This is a wonderful product. I got it for my boyfriend for christmas and he absolutely loves it. It is a bit on the bulky side but it's worth it. Amazon had the best price out of all the tens of places I looked. They were fast about shipping it during the holiday too!  

+ If you don't mind the size, this is the greatest portable media player out there.... And you can't really make it any smaller if you want to still take advantage of the 3.5 inch screen and 30 Gb....  And I've never heard a better sound than the one coming from my Toshiba....  

+ I found the Gigabeat very easy to handle and use. Loading pictures was quick and easy. The best feature is playing the slide show, with music, on a big screen TV. Highly recomended.  

+ Order was shipped very promptly.  Sale price was a steal. Easy to use and performance is great. Very satified with product and purchase.  

+ This is a wonderful product, beware of the movies feature. It was somewhat involved to get them on there. It also doesn't charge when connected to the USB port. Other than that, it works great!  

+ This ROCKS!!  I love it except for not having a radio, will totally recommend it.  

+ This player is easy to use, has great sound, and a much larger video screen than the ipod video.  The only downside is that are no protective cases to be found for this model.  I'm using a PDA case, and it seems to work out OK.  

+ It's great, the screen is clear, the music sound nice, and the pictures show clear with nice size screen.  

+ More space then IPOD for less cost.  Easy navigation.  Nothing very fancy.  A lot bigger than an IPOD though, so if you are looking for size you might want to reconsider.  Also does not come with a carrying case, will have to buy one or make one.  Overall, great product!  

+ This player is decent. It isn't bad, but it isn't good either.  

+ Apple Computer's iPod Photo: GOOD.  Getting sucked into an unscrupulous marketing ploy: BAD.  The flood of unwanted email, telemarketing calls, and faxes you'll receive after signing up for an "offer": UGLY!!  

+ It is very easy to sync this item to your computer and it does everything automatically. Plug it in, and very quickly it has added all your new files. Anyone who has seen mine has liked it more then an Ipod.  

+ This is the first mp3 player I have owned and I love it!  Wonderful for watching movies and/or listening to music.  Has a wonderful screen and great sound.  The only bad part, for me, was that the console itself is a little bulky.  Othewise it is a great product! I would recomend this product.  

+ Great MP3 player.  Worked wonderfully with Vista.  Good volume, easy to use, great sound.  Good price.  I am very pleased with the unit.    

+ I can't find a single thing to complain about.  This little thing has EXCELLENT battery life (WAY more than an IPOD).  This is an EXCELLENT buy.  

+ Before buying this one my main worry was that it may not be mac compatible. It was a relief to know that the XNJB solves that issue, and the product is far better than an ipod shuffle, for that matter.   

+ This and the black Zen V Plus were bought for my two daughters for Christmas. Both were VERY happy to get the players for their present. Thank you for assisting me in making them both truely happy.  

- Player stops playing songs randomly. No rhyme or reason, just stops. You have to hit play twice and the song starts where it left off. FM radio works very well, it's too bad it has bugs. I am returning mine and will try a different brand.   

+ I purchased the Zen media player for my husband for Valentine's Day.  He loves it!  He immediately loaded it with music and pictures.  My husband is sometimes hard to please, but he surely loved this item very, very much.  Now I want one for me too!  

+ I'd like to rate this product, but it was ordered by me as a gift for my daughter... she is very pleased with it.  

- The zen concisistently froze and had to be reset, finally it would not turn off or do any other functions and could not be reset.  I had this product 2 weeks.  I have since returned the product for a full refund.  1/08/07  

+ Outstanding quality and plenty of space. My only drawback is that I wish the speakers were a little louder but are still quite impressive for such a small package.  

+ I love this little player.  I am on the road 4 to 5 hours a day in a vehicle with no radio.  I am in and out of the vehicle dealing with the public and it is not allowed to wear earpieces of any kind. This player if perfect. The sound is great for such a small speaker.  

+ This MP3 player is excellent for my purposes because it has a built in speaker and I can use it to listen to quiet music whenever I want to, even to help me sleep.  

+ I had it for about an week and it started to freeze for no reason. Everytime i yurn it on, the volume goes down and then freezes on the music icon. There is no number to contact customer service so beware.   

+ I have bought 3 of these so far for my family. They all love it for its one unique feature and that is its speaker. My family loves music but hates head phones or ear buds for long periods of time. So this is just the perfect music player for them.   

+ Buy this K5 and you will be amazed how will the belt in speaker sounds and the FM radio works great.  

- Purchase this item for my wife at Christmas. She really thinks it is a great player. The sound that it puts out is great. Highly recommend. The shipment of this item was excellent.  

+ this mp3 player smokes any other player i have seen it is awesome  

+ There are plenty of the DVD transfer softwares for iPod and PSP, but no way to Vision W. As like a good Digita SLR Camera without a flash memory.  

+ So easy to use, big beautiful screen, great battery life for such a large device, plays every music, video, and picture format I throw at it, compactflash reader, excellent audio quality, highly recommend.  If looking for something smaller, not very small, quite large, but still pocketable.  

+ This player works great and the software with it makes it easy to transfer stuff to it.  

+ outstanding product, thinking of buying another one for myself, great picture easy to use, nice size. this is the next step in these types of units  

+ throw away ipod and zune this one is great i love it. Easy to tranfer your songs and music. You can delete right from your zen which I love. It's easy to load and delete. The picture is great. I love it  

+ Easy to use and beats the CD player.  My only reservation is that rechargeable batteries are not the best choice to use with this mp3 player.  

+ The product was delivered on time and so far works just as advertised. Small, portable, ideal for jogging with a proper set of jogging headphones. It does come with ordinary headphones.  

+ Which is the difference between this (item model: MA452LL/A) and the 30 GB iPod SE with video playback (item model: MA664LL/A)???? I do not see any...  

+ The IPOD is great but i have not been able to get the free video coupon included to work. Thanks John Clayton  

+ Okay, so this is my first ipod, which means I may be somewhat easily impressed. Regardless, I'm VERY happy with my purchase. My only complaint would be that I don't think the battery lasts nearly as long as advertised. Other than that, it rocks!  

+ I love this ipod, love the red, n the signed back, cool to look at and cool all around, love the new screen, big bright.  

+ it was a gift, and liked very much!! we couldn't order till close to holidays, so the prompt service on shipping was really appreciated  

+ Which was Nomadland.  The Bono-pod is beautiful.  However the inconsistency of the iPod itself is a nightmare.  I've had it just over a month now and it has started to randomly skip songs.  It's apparently a known problem with several models of the device, with no particular fix.  Great.    

+ Excellent iPOD easy to download music especially from iTunes. Love the balck with Red dial and the laser engraved signatures are awesome.  

+ Excellent, I enjoy it a lot. Its a finger print magnet like others have said. Other wise I enjoy it especially being a fan of U2 and that it looks different from your normal IPODS this will get heads rolling.   

+ Over all it's good value for the money. The only things I don't like are the charging via USB and the fact that you have to be connected to delete tracks. Next time I'll probably look for something more user friendly.  

+ this is a very good mp3 player for its price. the sound quality is great, and  the graphics are pretty decent.  

+ Considering I do not like ipods, this sansa is awesome.  Only thing I do not like is that when you are charging it (uses USB), you can not listen to it.  Battery life is amazing.  I love the size and color screen and ease of syncing with pc's.  

+ Purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  She loves it, and that is all that counts.  

- After 3 months now only one speaker on the headphone works,no way to fix that.  

+ Well i have had this product for a while and it still works great. The price of $60.00 is worth it the bad thing about is its screen resolution sucks but the screen is very bright. Bottom line its worth buying.  

+ works just like advertised,did not come with instructions but luckily my daughter knew how to work it!  

+ I have really loved this new player. It's a great little player and perfect for use at school. Battery life is good and the sound is good as well. No complaints!  

+ I've bought this MP3 player recently and I'm very much satisified with it's excellent performance  

+ This has been a great purchase so far!  I haven't had any problems.  It arrived in perfect shape and very quickly.  I love it!  

+ I love this player my 12 pack cd player broke I use this in my car and it is perfect.   

+ Great unit, holds alot of music, easy to use and compact.  

+ perfect for the price, i purchased 3 T9's and they are all working great.  

- It's the second one I bought today....the first one froze when I was trying to do my first donwload...went back to Circuit City and got another one...the second one was even worse...never turned on! Tomorrow I'll go back to get an IPOD!  

- I purchased this unit and had to return it and bought Creative Labs Zen player instead because Samsung is known for their bad software. Avoid at all cost all Samsung products that require software to run.   

- I am not going to fool with this difficult to use MP3 player.  I have installed the driver and uninstalled it many times.  I have tried to manually install the driver using the instruction.  Nothing works.  Looks really nice, but setting up is difficult.  

- the first one broke and did not work the second one broke and did not work-all before I left the house-it wasted 3+hours of my time, I subscribed to music and still have not gotten another player.  I was really disappointed -  

- Neat little player that worked great for me for almost 3 months.  Then it dies for no apparent reason other than it is poorly made junk.  You hit the scroll wheel and it turns off.  I wish the power button worked half as well.  I'm shopping for a new player but it won't be one from Creative.  

- I bought this product and it was dead within a month, even though there was absoutely no damage or misuse. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.   

- This was returned because it was impossible to operate.i bought an IPOD that downloads like a charm!!  

- C'mon - this is ridiculous. I just bought it. Great unit. Reason I bought was for audio quality. Can't use any of my WMA Lossless? If I had realized that, I would've just bought an iPod for the inferior audio quality. Also, it takes forever to upload it.   

- When I went to the post office to pick up the package, there was nothing in the box.  I had waited three weeks for it.  Thankfully, I got my money back but then I had to go somewhere else to buy it.  I originally wanted to buy it from Amazon because it was $50 cheaper.  I'll never do it again.  

- The player was broken after three day I got it. The screen is totally dead.   

- This is the most annoying mp3 player, too difficult to use & I consider myself pretty good at this kind of thing.  Too many programs and not enough information to help you out.  

- the item freezes and does not charge propperly once it has most of its memory filled.  

- I purchased this product just a little over 3 weeks ago and it has already given me problems. One of the selector buttons doesn't always respond and I don't think it worth the time or money to send back to get this reoccuring problem fixed. I don't recommend this product to anyone.    

- got product, powered on, no display visable. the sound from the fm radio was nice, but there was no display.  spoke with coby customer service, they had never heard of this problem. suggested return to amazon. wont try that brand again.  

- this player is a huge piece of crap, i just got it today and the radio stopped working on the third use. the mp3 player works, for now!  dont buy this item, their customer support at Coby isnt worth calling either.  !!! DONT BUY THIS ITEM, IF YOU DO CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!!  

- First couple of days I was pleased with this player and the ability to be a thumb drive.  But then it stopped playing entire songs and when downloaded to it would "lose" half of the book I wanted to listen to.  I have since returned this item and purchased a Sansa an love it.  

- A high-tech piece of junk! I was very impressed with it when I first got it in the mail. After a couple of weeks, while trying to transfer some music files on it, the device just went dead and would not re-start. Make sure you  consider the risks before deciding to purchase it.  

- The Zune arrived quickly, but it didn't work. I had to send it to Microsoft and they sent me a new one. It took over two weeks to get it back.  

- Zune worked great XMas (first) day, but would not turn on again after first recharge. Amazon was great about taking the product back (sent back before the new year). Only thing they didn't tell me was I won't get a replacement till Feb 28 (earliest). Hopefully next one will work???  

- Bought 2 units for christmas presents..and 1 is dead just after a few  hours. The light displays would not turn off...even after several unit resets. A couple of days after it would'nt even charge anymore... I should have read the fine print....Made In China  

- I bought this Mp3 for my daughter for Xmas - not wanting to spend alot because of her age (12)- after ONE WEEK it wouldn't hold a charge, would not power down completely, and had to be reset every time we wanted to do ANYTHING with it!!!!  Not worth the problems!!!!!  

- I am Very Disappointed, I like the brand Sandisk, but this product is bad.  I bought the item because of the brand, then I read the reviews, and now I have problem with the product, it does not work anymore.  I repeat it again, I am very very Disappointed.  

- I got this as a gift from my wife just this past Christmas. It completely died mid-song while I was walking to the supermarket. And that was only the fourth or fifth time that I used it. Caveat emptor.   

- My unit lasted about four days.  It performed very well until it shut down last night.  Now it refuses to boot... maybe the screen is dead.  Either way, it's a lemon.  After checking out reviews at other sights, this problem is not so uncommon.  I'm returning my unit today for a refund.  

- This product is very hard to understand how to operate. I have had both my daughters to try to get it to set and neither one can do it. I wish I had bought and easier on to operate.  

- this product its bad at the second time Ive used it broke out and it can be use    

- I have two of the 605 30gb and the dvr recorder.  They work great except if you wish to use the dvr recorder in combination with a motorola cable box - then the dvr does not work as described.  This is a known problem discussed on other sites.  

- Terrible Christmas gift.  I wish we would have gotten the I Touch instead first.  We struggled with this device for over a week trying to buy the software to go on line with it, but it never worked. No one ever answered the phone in 10 days of trying and being on hold for hours.  

- After Zen spend 2 hours constantly uploading more and more software onto my desktop, it wouldn't even let me transfer a single itunes song to it. Sure, it says it's possible, but after days and days of trying to convert this and uploading that, I just gave up. A BIG waste of money.   

- Overall the device performed well, though I never got to put it through a long term test. After connecting to my PC, the device would sync about 25% of the time and simply shut down the other 75% of the time, requiring me to disconnect it and stick a paper-clip in the reset hole.     

- Yes, the color screen is great, but.... It's embarrasingly large, and even heavier. The ear buds won't stay in your ears and it didn't come with a protective carrier or clip of any sort. No FM, no voice recording. For the money, i think there are better picks out there.  

- If you use windows music media 10 you might have problems with the program I.D. the device. Sansa web faq shows only window music media 11. There are differences between these programs that are not addressed. Also, Sandisk customer help is really lacking.  

- I bought this mp3 player for my son, and it is a piece of junk. We had to replace the first one because it wouldn't boot up, and now we're taking back the second. I will never buy a SanDisk mp3 player again.  

- The first time out of the box, the weight from the usb cord pulled it off the table onto the ground and that was the end of my Zune.  

- I bought a Zune to replace an iPod that I lost. Bad decision! The battery seems to go out right away, and I never use the Wifi for anything - so I feel a bit like I paid for something I'll never use.   In the end, I bought a new iPod, and have been much happier with it.  

- Earphones fall apart in about 4 weeks, wire length for earphones is way too short to even place in a pocket, easily gets scratched, easily gets dented, hard to navigate, cheap menues, dont buy it or else youll regret it.  

- Until Sony ditches their proprietary ATRAC format stay away....stay VERY far away!  

- for the first month i had it this thing was great. but then when i dropped it on my bed it wouldnt play right. every 3 seconds it went on and off, on and off. get something better.  

- I bought this a year ago. It lasted a month. It's a piece of crap. When it did work, the volume was pathetic.  But it is poorly designed with small buttons that can be press accidentally too often.  And it just is cheap.  Buy a sturdier model or wait.  

- I bought this little guy and was really excited.  I installed all the software on my Windows 2000. When i tried to put my songs on the player, it said i had no memory!?! I even put in 64 MB extra! Its very annoying. I wouldnt reccomend this product.  

- Never buy any product from rio ever, this is a horible product and I couldn't get anyone to tell me how to get it to work.  I was absolutly horrible  

- Find something else -- software is not intuitive and requires a lot of manipulation to organize music.  Hardware is just as bad -- mine lasted three months before a complete crash.  

- Great for a few months then died - do not buy.  

- The player has so little memory your lucky to get an hour of music out of it.  Memory Cards that fit this cost $50 a piece, too.  Don't even think about buying this.  

- If anyone has the piece between the main device and the headphone jack that they can send me that would be great.  I could revive the player otherwise it's dead...  

- i bot this player about a year ago and guess what its already making buzzing sounds i e-mailed their customer service , and they tell me to get new headphones. I GOT NEW HEADPHONES  IT STILL BUZZING. the radio feature never worked right.  

- Don't buy this the 128Mb version is just about to be made available for just a few pounds more.  

- Don't believe the hype.  It is a great player and you so much want to love it, but it freezes all the time and crashes my PC.  

- This MP3 player gave me AIDS. That is why I don't enjoy using it very too much.  

- This is by far the worst MP3 player on the market.  Do not buy.  I had mine less than a year and it completely stopped working!  RCA refused to repair it or replace it.  You are better off with the IPOD!!  

- You have a _great_ product here. I loved having it. The sound is good, and rechargeable batteries make it so convenient.  You need to do two things with this product:  1) Allow music to come from a SD card  2) Use USB 2.0  Then you will have a winner and I'd definitely get one.  I returned mine.   

- This is a fantastic product - if you can get it. I ordered a 256MB DMK, but it came with a 128MB device in the 256MB box!<p>If you order this product, check it as soon at it arrives and make sure you get what you pay for.  

- 1.  The headphones broke within one month at the gym. 2.  New software is not compatible with WinXP SP2.  I thought it was just me but I did a search and many people have had problems with it.  Not just the DMK but all the MPIO products.  

- This has to one of the worst items I ever bougth. It destroyed 4 San Disk SD memory cards. I will never buy another Memorex product again because of it.   

- I got one of these for Christmas, and I didn't even get to listen to a single song. The user-interface for the FM tuner did not work very well, so I followed the manual's instructions to do a firmware upgrade. I formatted as per the manual, and now the player is dead. Complete waste of money IMHO.  

- itunes and the Ipod are no match for the Napster service and the Samsung Napster player. Napster and its player has more features and more music to chose from. Go to a bestbuy and compare the two products. Ipod is lame compared to the Napster player  

- Note that the user manual says you cannot jog with this device, which to me means it can't take normal teenager use.  I'm not buying another one for my child.  

- I bought this only to have it break within a month.  This product is too fragile for normal use.  

- This is the version of the Creative Nomad Zen Xtra with a faulty headphone jack. You want item model number 70PD055000032, not 70PD055000017. The other one is the same product, just manufactured at a later point and they have fixed the headphone jack problem. Hope this helps.   

- What's going on Creative Labs?  Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is "sold out" or more likely "discontinued" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm....  

- I have had mine for about 60 days now and it just broke today.   I truly loved this player. I had great features and could seamlessly import playlists from Napster. There must be a reason why they don't make this one anymore...  There are tons of refurbished players on the market. Guess why?    

- I am using this unit, but have to manually record which track I was last at when I shut it off. If I had known this before I bought this I would not have considered this unit. Lexar needs to fix this issue before this is a viable MP3 player.  

- I bought this unit when it was so much more pricey.  I used it for  a little while and then the usb connection was broken or without making contact.  I sent the unit in for repairs and it came back fixed but to it was broken again a few weeks after.   Worthless piece of equipmment.   

- Wasn't satisfied with the product.  After searching on Amazon.com, I found CreativeLabs Nomad Muvo Slim 256 MB MP3 Player and decided to give it a try.  

- i bought this along time ago and had it a good while, but one day it fell in the toilet yes i know, it was in my pocket and fell out and boom short circut but it was awsome lol.  

- Creative's Nomad Jukebox's are garbage. I've had my player for less than a year and it just stopped being functional for the second time.  The thing is not built to last more than a few months.  I don't like apple but better to buy an ipod than throw money away on this.    

- I BOUGHT ZEN XTRA  AND THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS THE OS CRASHED OR FROZE UP ON ME. FINALY THIS THIN STOPED WORKING DUE TO HARDDISK PROBLEM. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY AND I RECOMMEND AN IPOD OR IAUDIO X5.   

- It worked for a few days, then could not synchronize with computer, and ewentually went dead, luckly enough  I was able to send it back for refund.  

- I bought one for 124.00 and I used it all of three days went online and got the update for the drivers and it froze on the start up screen so I have a very expensive paper weight.  

- It arrived broken. Getting it replaced by apple has already taken a week and a half, and they don't plan to get it to me until another week from now. So now I'm having to wait almost a month before I get the stupid thing, and god knows if it'll even work then.  

- Like one of the previous reviewers, my player conked out. It was a great little easy-to-use player but just upped and died on me. I've had it for only seven months.   

- Yes I mean it! The thing dead on me the first day I use it!!!!   

- Rio's products are horrible, and the Carbon is no exception.  Looks nice, but will break within weeks.  The controller pad failed on me, making it half useless.  Not to mention that the  battery is not replaceable and so when it dies in 1-2 years, so will your Carbon.  

- This player completely froze while loading music. After that it wouldn't even power on. I couldn't get anyone at technical service. I am returning this piece of garbage. I have never been so displeased with an electronic product in my life. I urge you all to stay away.    

- I bought the Rio Forge 256 MB in June of 2005 by December it would not work.  The Rio has only a 90 day warrenty on labor so they would replace it for $70 if I wanted to send it in.  Having paid $90 for it new I told them what they could do with it.  

- The IPOD purchased worked only two weeks.  I am in the process of trying to contact the seller to get reimbursement or replacement.  

- Unfortunately the product never came.  The actually company said it was shipped, but it never came.  I can not give any stars to this company, as they did not answer my e-mail request for an update.  The star is for Amazon, who was able to get me a refund for my purchase.  

- Gave it one star because there was no option for zero. Died after two days of use, would not turn on or reset. Previous Zen Nano, same thing after six months of use. I guess that would be my last Creative product.  

- Although this player is waterproof & shock resistant the download is slow and cumberson and when the player is shut off it reverts back to the first song.  I would not recomend this player.  

- Do not buy this I bought this instead of an ipod..big mistake!!! FOR MY BIRTHDAY :(  

- I would NOT recommend this product. It will not work well, causing more problems than it is good for. Look at another option!  

- This player can hardly fit any music in it and the one that I bought would make constant sounds when was used on the FM mode. Thus, it couldn't be used as a radio and neither it could store enogh songs to be considered an mp3 player. Do not buy this.   

- Why do supposedly reputable companies not check out the items they sell?  This TRIO MP3 player is junk. If the largest-selling O/S doesn't support it, DON'T SELL IT!!!   

- Hard to figure out and organize music... battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often... don't recommend it. Very "Not happy"  

- As with everyone else, I have to wiggle and jiggle my headphone jack to get it even remotely close to working.  This makes it not only impossible to use when running, but even when just walking or moving at all.  For the same price you could get an iPod or better.  

- I loved this tiny, brilliant machine.  However, the one I bought broke in the first three months.  Radioshack immediately gave me a replacement, but this has stopped turning on, a mere three weeks later.  

- After about 3 months it won't power up, and I haven't even received my rebate yet! I have seen other reviews with this same problem. This player only has a 90 day warranty. Other manufactures offer 12 months. I would not buy this player again.  

- Please don't buy it, don't make this mistake!!. I bought it and after 3 weeks this piece of **** didn't work anymore. I don't want to see the "Fatal Error System" every time that i want to listening to the music. Save your money and keep it to buy a good MP3 player.     

- Google this item and see how defective it is. Olympus stopped making them for a reason. Radioshack, Target, etc stopped carrying them for a reason.  My M:Robe has a missing/invalid file. There was no remedy besides sending this device to Olympus for repairs.  You get what you pay for...  

- Really ugly mp3 player.  Did the Sandisk designer ever check out the ipod?  Features are just average.  No surprise.  

- My daughter got this for Christmas and the screen cracked after one month.  It wasn't dropped, or damaged in any way.  I called Apple & they basically told me it was our fault and too bad.  I won't buy any Apple product again.  That's the quickest $300 I've ever wasted.  Buyer beware!  

- worked for a month on and off and now doesent work at all.   

- I was really excited to about the iRiver H10...until I tried to set it up and discovered that it only works with Windows XP and nothing else. It had all the features I wanted and it would have been great, but I am not changing my operating system just to use an mp3 player.  

- The player is stylish, compact, has decent sound, and is easy enough to use. However, after two weeks it wouldn't operate. I couldn't access the menus, music wouldn't play, and the player was no longer recognized by my computer. It went right back to Amazon!!  Stay away from this one...  

- For some reason I had a hard time getting the music to download properly onto the player. I have worked with different MP3's, but cant seem to work the kinks out and get the music to actually play on this one. Having said that I cant rate it fairly.  

- The program it comes with is terrible, hardly ever works, labels ripped CDs as 'no information', it does not have enough options or features, is hard to navigate, touch thing doesnt light up so its near impossible to work at night.... i could go on... works but is a pain and is just poorly made.   

- Sony's proprietary software really sucks. Hard to tranfer mp3, wma files to network walkman. Unable to connect to Connect Music store. Unable to transfer music I bought from Connect to my walkman. That sucks! I promise myself never buying any propretary stuffs from Sony.  

- This device is not a MP3 player because it just plays Sony's audio format (ATRAC), so you always have to convert your MP3 files into ATRAC format using a software provided by the manufacturer (that is not so easy to use).  

- I was disappointed in this purchase because it was obsolete before it arrived.  I ordered it to give as a gift but was unable to do so because it was out of date.  The price was close to retail so I was unaware of this situation.  It sits in my closet now with no real value.  

- I saw nothing in the advertisement to indicate this was a refurbished ipod.  It seems to be working great but I thought I was getting a new one.    

- Ok, the 2 girls wanted one each. Looks simple, 1st page plug and and follow the directions. Well page 5 tells you how to change it, I have it plug in and  charging going on 3 1/2 hours and still on the opening screen, do not disconnect.  

- The headphones that come with this mp3 player have very poor sound quality. The buttons are very difficult to use and the volume blasts all the way up for no reason. It also drains batteries. I decided to buy an iPod and liked it a thousand times better.  

- I liked the fact I could replace battery instead of waiting for charge. Music was not so good sounding so I used for audiobooks only.  

- It may have been a good product for some people, but my son only was able to use it for a day or two.  I'm completely disgusted.  I don't know what to do.  

- if the back of the creative comes off, which it does verry easily, and the battery comes out, the harddrive will get all messed up and you will need to buy a new one, it happened to me as i was driving.  

- Sweat gets into it easily during exercising and eventually malfunctions even after drying up. Otherwise plays well, sleek look, great size.  

- Get A CREATIVE ZEN OTHER THAN THIS STUPID PIECE OF WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Zen has a REPLACEABLE that you don't have send in. Zen lasts twice as long as an iPod. BOO iPod!!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   

- First of all, I got a white ipod. I ordered black! But other than that, it came pretty slow, and it was missing the installation disc.  

- Player randomly goes into "repeat song" mode. Music vanishes from the player. Do not buy this junk.  

- Item was horrible, kept freezing my computer and itself, had to reset both multiple times, horrible effort, sent it back  

- Well...I am on my 4th and soon to be on my 5th...thank God for an extended warranty from Staples...since I have had mine, It has either been sent off or broke down.  I was a loyal Palm user but the life drive is a pure piece of tech. junk...steer clear!!!  

- I can't beleive these reviews at all after I experience the product & service. They sent a defective item, impossible to get in touch with customer service (only voice message without no return call). I am reserching how to refund. My friend inform me same experience.  

- The manual for this player is absolutely useless and their web site is no better. I tried calling their tech support and was told to leave a message. You guessed it - no return call. I'm returning it today and replacing it with one that  comes with a decent manual.  

- The controls are a little annoying and it reboots for no reason every once in a while (as noted in other reviews).  

- I've had this for 4 weeks now and haven't yet figured out how to program it.  I did manage to download songs but it won't play them became because of a "file error".  I'm pretty computer literate but this thing has me stumped.   

- This MP3 player broke as soon as I tried to use the player. It only turned on once and would never could be turned on again.   

- The software that is required to download music is not recognized by my computer.  The instructions are horrible.  The product is useless to me. I wrote the company asking for advice but never received any.  

- I am very displeased with this mp3 player.  There is no case or armband to hold it and the ear buds are very awkward.  You get what you pay for and although the price is reasonable enough...it's not worth 32 dollars!  

- i bought 4 of these as christmas presents and they all died within 1 month. would not recommend this item  

- It plays videos, but according to the Apple website, you get two hours of video playback before your battery drains.  Crash and burn.  

- From the other reviews, this mp3 player is excellent and is better than a ipod. But i hear taht it crashes a lot. There's tons of problem with it like not being able to turn on and music deletion. i still want this. Can someone clear all this up for me.  

- The sound quality drops off when running or even walking. <br>It dropped off so badly that very often it would stop all together (crashes). <p>The FM reception also needs improvement.  

- this is not a good mp3 at all. its seriously laughable. mine crapped out on me after just 2 weeks. plus, the menus werent exactly the easiest to use, even for a one line readout. i would not buy this mp3 player if i were you.  

- Maybe you won't notice. I didn't at first. There is a faint squeal in the background. I double-checked; it's not in the music files (they sounded fine in a Creative player). I mostly listen to classical music and the squeal really stands out during the quiet parts. Took it back the next day.  

- This MP3 player was a huge dissapointment. It was dead on arrival. Did not function properly. I even had my 18 year old coworker make sure that I wasn't doing something wrong.     

- Not only wouldn't my product work, but it discharged the battery so fast the player was almost too hot to hold. I was on a move to Japan so had no time to demand a replacement.  I'd like to try a working model to see if it can deliver a satisfactory performance.   

- I must constantly reset the device; the sound quality is sub-par; the processor is slow; the USB/power-cord combo is bulky; works only with Windows Media Player (e.g. not with Rhapsody).  Get a Zen Vision instead.  Worst $300 I ever spent.  

- I purchased 2 of these for Christmas presents.  Both freeze for no reason while loading music.  Rio tech support is totally useless.  After 45 minutes they said they knew about an issue with some refubs going out un-checked.  I will never buy a Rio product again after this mess.   

- Good:  Loved the look of the Rio Carbon, easy to use, great sound.   Very Bad: Volume wheel stuck wouldn't turn. I wonder about quality control at RIO.   

- After I started using my player, the screen failed and it took me 2 months to replace it with the new one. I had done a lot of research before I bought this model, but I will never buy another creative product especially mp3 player in my life again.  

- The player did not work out of the box. Just appears as an unknow device. After changing my BIOS settings to support USB 2.0, it still did not work, even when a USB 2.0 flash drive did. In all fairness, I have not tried to return it or have it replaced yet.  

- It might be something wrong with the USB power and unit on at the same time.  I needed to return for a refund.  

- This hunk of junk isnt worth a cent, and it is as heavy as a brick..  

- I am disappointed in the product as it is obviously not a NEW, unopened nano--as advertised--but looks to be a re-packaged used and/or refurbished product.  

- Had an ipod that stopped worked exactly after the warranty period. Apple then explains to you that you cannot pay to have it repaired, it is not in their policy! You can try to find somebody to open it. Other friends had the same problem, end of the warranty, and the ipod stops working/be warned.   

- I never received the product.  It was shipped by the merchant.,and delivered to the Post Office but not to me.  I called Amazon and received a refund immediately.  

- profoundly average.  i should have listened to my kids. another poorly conceived, indifferently executed product from the folks who brought us Vista. i've had it, it's my last Microsoft anything. nearly 20 years a loyal consumer, what a DUNCE. save your money, you know it, ..... get an iPod.  

- i got this on october 30th and i used it for four months and the screen died on it.i would not reccommend it at all.a waste of money.  

- The software is freezing the computer, I tested it in my desktop and my laptop. And you can't transfer the files using the windows explorer, you have to use the sony's software.  

- Love the style of this MP3 player, very gym friendly however when it came to a bit of water on the player, it died and was never usable again, went through 2 players and the same thing happened.  

- I knew the sync software wouldn't work on a mac, but i had expected to be able to drag-n-drop my music and video onto it in data mode.  But this won't show up at all, not even as a drive or storage device.  Probably works great, but if you have a mac, it doesn't work at all so i had to return it.  

- This product may look good but I've experienced problems with freezing, windows could not read the driver, I felt lik I was on a merry go round sending this product back to amazon for replacements.   

- I got this mp3 player in October. It worked fine, and was a great purchase......up until now. It's all messed up! It only plays some of my songs, and it won't even play some of those songs sometimes. It even skips over most of my music! I'm not buying a creative mp3 player again!  

- Well, it lasted for two weeks until the screen turned sideways, and all of the options froze.  We tried to follow the directions to reset the player...didn't change anything.  Our daughter was not happy.  

- I bought 3 Zen v plus and the 3 brake after 1 month. They send me 3 refubished zen.  

- Questionable functionality.  Joy stick was frozen, unable to get it to release, don't know if unit plays, since can't access menu.  Returned to Creative, replaced, second unit frozen also.  Creative refuses to refund money, only offers support to continue troubleshooting.  I am unhappy camper.  

- I purchased a Creative Zen V mp3 player 3 weeks ago - during the course of a walk the on/off switch fell off and got lost.  The company refuses warranty coverage claiming normal wear and tear.  This is a poorly made product, do not purchase one.  

- THis is ok with space, but what would have been nice is if it came with a recharger, as it happens I tried to ask amazon if they could help me find one but they never got back to me. Rechargable batteries without a recharger is stupid.   

- You are a liar!!!!! I know i purchased a 2GB (New) Player and i got a 1GB (used) player without headphones too. I will be reporting this to the amazon community  

- I as well do not own this.  This machine missed the boat. Like the other reviewer said, it NEEDS 802.11g and I think the screen should be a minimum of 10" like the viewsonic airpanel and  a 15" upgrade would be cool.  

- The iPod Classic does not work with Mac OS X 10.3.9.  If you are running 10.3.9, you have to put up the money for 10.4 to be able to use the iPod.  Seeing as how 10.5 is on the way, you get to either wait or buy something soon to be outdated, dropping a lot of extra money either way.    

- Don't expect your 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime to arrive in 2-3 days. It's been almost as week and I still haven't received mine. UPS says it's still in transit.  

- What happened to the slip case?  For this kind of money, and with all ongoing fuss about scratches to the screen etc., it's unbelievably inconsiderate (not to mention cheap) of Apple not to give you a very basic case to help protect it from wear and tear.     

- I purchased this ipod for my 14 year old grandson as a gift. He received it Oct. 2 2007 and in less than 2 weeks it failed. He gets a red X on the screen when he tries to recharge the battery.    

- Was purchased primarily for wi-fi found out it will not work with "N" but should work with the older versions...... so I wait.. .support was excelent!  

- This device is tied to Yahoo Music, and Yahoo music is shutting down, so this thing is worthless.  Buy an iPod.  

- this is a piece of junk.  I used it for one day, and then stopped working.  I didn't even get a chance to upload any songs.  I only used it one day to listen to internet music.  

- Product is okay.  This is the second one as the 1st one broke within a week of purchase.  Unable to "shake" the player to get it to skip to the next song.  

- slow in responding to commands. volume went like half volume just after full coverage warranty expired. Was great before that.  

- Works great if you just want to record tv shows.  Hi tech substitute for VCR.  Extra functions cost more -- not worth the money ie web browser, wifi function.  Media Player: ssllooww! I only use it to record tv show I dont want to miss.  I am sure you could find something better.  

- I purchased an Archos 605 160 GB WiFi for Christmas.  It sync'd with my computer once and after that I received an error message stating the device had malfunctioned.  I had to return it and I'm still waiting for my credit card to be refunded.  Terrible purchase, don't do it!!!!  

- We bought this product so we could download items from Dish or Tivo and it can do neither  

- I ordered this mp3 because of the color, well the functions are good, but I like this cotton candy pink color, so I ordered it, but when i received the package, the color is totally not what i expected, that's why i'm returning this one.  (i'll post the actual color later on.)  

- I bought this to jog with because of the built in clip. It stopped working after a month. I have done some digging - a-lot of people are having the same problem.  Bought a Nano instead - sounds great. It's been working fine for a month.  

- The player is very easy to use but the battery life is quite poor. I could barely get 1 hour of play time after each charge. The battery would discharge completely, after a full charge, if the player was left unused for 2-3 days.  

- I got mine from audible.com, it was refurbished and it truly will work when it wants to, regardless of new battery or position.  

- They describe this item as being epandable to 340 MB. However, the manual and an inspection of the product indicates no expansion capability.  Additionally, it was shipped to me with missing parts.  

- WMA's play fine on computer but have skip like noises when transferred...MP3's over 2 minutes never finish, will go right into the next song unexpectedly.<p>Nice package...bad product.  

- I purchased my Nomad II in December of 2000.  In October of 2001 it died on me.  I threw it away and purchased an Intel player.  Beware of Creative MP3 players.  

- Tech support is only written on instrucsons not adbalable anywere elsa mine just stoped working.  

- I'm an experienced techie and was unable to get this device to be detected by my laptop or Windows Media Player.  Research brought me to an iRiver enthusiasts site where I found approximately 20 other people were having the exact same problem and giving up and returning the devices.  

- Provides  6-8 hours per battery change.<p>Works better than previous SonicBlue models  

- Bought one today at J&amp;R Music World.  It does not work, windows XP do not recognise it as a removable device.  I am very upset...  

- It was good for like 2 months but then it just quits working.  It's too good of a deal, come on man 40 gigs for $300 the controls start to where out.  The car kit that comes with it bleaps out every 2 minutes.  Trust me if you want a good buy don't get this.  

- this product stinks. i recieved one for my 21 birthday and im returning it . all it is is a hastle okay ya sure the player has style but downloading music is  a task in itself i would not reccomend this product to anyone.  

- This is the worst product I have seen. If you work on Windows XP and have dowloaded there most recent update SP2 this product will not work. Please refer to their website www.mpio.com. I am returning mine ASAP       

- I recently bought this product after I had two RCA Lyras die on me.  I thought that this was a good purchese but two days after I got it i changed my mind when it died on me. I do not think that the tecnology is good enough to make this a good purchese.  

- I wonder how they can sell these things with the battery life of about 2 hours? Oh, but what about when it crashes and locks up?  REBOOT. I would check out the others first before I invest in this.  

- Nothing here to be excited about. Only Palm devotees will be buying this one at $499. I can get two iPods for this kind of money, double my storage for everything from music to contacts, and have money left over. Palm-late to the party (again).  

- DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended.  Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke.  The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb.  

- GET A SONY NET MD WALKMEN!!!!!!!!!! WAY BETTER!!!!!!!!!  

- The Jumpgear *only* works with Lexar Jumpdrives. Lexar made the software to reject other USB drives, even if they fit in the player. Lame.  

- One day it just stopped playing in the middle of a song, only six months after purchase and used very little.  Nothing Creative says will help fix it and of course I'm out of luck, big waste of money...don't buy this you have been warned!    

- Got this as a Christmas present for my daughter. After two months, it won't do anything, won't emergency rest, nothing.   

- Broken after seven months.  What a waste of money, now I have to spend $150-200 again to buy a real mp3 player.  

- as I am after buying a Rio Nitrus. I will save myself a lot of work: Just read the reviews for the Nitrus.   

- My Forge 256 crashed when adding an expansion card.  Can't even turn it on anymore.  Nothing the help line suggests works and they've made no move to accept responsibility.  I'm furious with Rio and will never buy their product again.  

- This is my second Rio Player and both have been useless within a year of very mild use.  When a Rio player breaks outside of the 90-day warrentee period, there is no support and no replacement.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  

- Sent a comment to Apple. The sound out of the iPod Mini is not as good as the Rio Pearl. I am getting a Rio Pearl and turning the iPod back in. DEFECTIVE SOUND from iPod.  Also the Battery does not last 12 hours, it lasts barely 6 hours.   

- Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods.   

- Some much better out there...  Suprisingly over priced for what you get.  

- No LCD, no ability to pick what you want to listen to and an crazy high price for something so feature devoid. Must be a collective dementia among the faithful  

- Have to agree with the majority of reviewers here, don't waste your time.  Mine died, and customer support very unhelpful.  

- A year later and I wish I had the money for an ipod. I have been having the audiojack issue for a long time and don't even take my player with me anywhere anymore. What's the point of having an mp3 player you can't walk around with? Ridiculous.  

- The ipod I purchased had no lower casing (broken off) and the control wheel was jammed / broken / did not work. I wasted my money, and am not pleased.  

- Like others have reported, the hard drive in the Mini is very delicate.  My wife's died within about 10 months. It can't be fixed, you have to get a new one.  So that's why the new Nano, which came out only about 1-2 years later doesn't used a hard drive.  Don't buy the Mini used, get a Nano.  

- I cancelled this purchase before it was shipped, because the Creative MP3 players are not compatible with Audible (my source for audio book downloads).  

- It did not work. From first time. I could not start, It did not charge. Pure aggrevation.  

- I gave this item 2 tries. The first unit would not power off.  Sent it back for replacement.  The second had the same problem, and also would not respond to attempts to change the play mode.  Returned for refund.  I still like Samsung mp3 players but this one didn't work for me.  

- This is the worst thing I have ever bought. I like iPods but this is just terrible. I had it for a day and it already had like 100 scratches on it. Like I said I like iPods, but this thing is as shame to apple  

- The ipod was totally scratched at the metal part of the back and hit in the front. This product was used by someone and sell as ref. Do NOT included CD and manual  I WONT RECOMMEND IT!!!    

- Went bad after one year, with battery life slowly draining.  After a year, just quit, demanding hard resets and would not wake back up.  This happened (of course) just after the warranty ran out.  

- when i bought this product it says it was display ipod's and wasn't any damage to the product what so ever.. The ipod i received looked like a dog literally was chewing on the thing. I wouldn't recommended ever doing business with this person   

- I brought this three hours ago. I had very hard time to install it on WindowXP. The support of either Iriver.com is terrible. Don't buy this product.   

- I bought this as a Christmas present. Be careful, it absolutely will NOT work with Windows 2000, or ME. No patches or fixes available. Any company that omits half of the operating sytems in the country from using their product must not hire the best nor brightest.   

- IT SUCKS SO BAD ITS OVER EXPENSIVE AND CANT DO ANYTHING GET A SANSA  

- I received this MP3 player less than 24 hours ago, and within the first hour of operation the unit froze up while I was fast forwarding through some text.  The unit remained locked up until the battery got low enough for the unit to turn off automatically.  I am returning it for a refund.    

- Save your money and buy an IPOD.  This product doesn't even come close and Itunes is so much better to deal with.  I sold mine on ebay.  

- I was looking forward to using this, but after several frustrating minutes of trying to install the accompanying software on my computer, I went to their website and found out that there is no software support for mac.  There are too many people like this that assume that everyone has a PC.  

- The Micro has some excellent features at the right price. But it fails to work all the time. First it was the firmware, then it wouldn't connect to my PC, now the hardware has failed. I am going to buy an I Pod, despite Apple's refusal to allow other forms of mp3 downloads.   

- If it were not for proprietary software to transfer files to and from the device I would still have it.  

- This product is super-annoying to use.  The screen is tiny and trying to scroll between icons is very difficult.  The instructions that come with it are terrible and those you find online are not much better.  I strongly recommend spending more money and getting something better.  

- Only works with Windows media player for transfers Not easy to work Bad sound (IAudio is better)  

- I purchased this H10 20Gb at full price.  It stopped working within 30 days and IRiver refused to honor their warranty.  They gave me the runaround for an entire year until the warranty ran out.  Now it's a $300 piece of junk.  THIS PRODUCT AND IT'S MANUFACTURER ARE NOT RELIABLE.  

- I sent my LifeDrive back after just two days.  It was increatably slow and the usb cable failed to connect to my pc unless I held it firmly in place.  My advice,,,don't buy this product.  

- It arrived on time, but the palm didn't work from the first time, I never received an answer from J&R and after all I changed thru the palm support.  

- At times it doesn't work right. You have to play with the buttons, it acts like the battery is dead, but I tried 3 different new batteries.  

- After spending hours downloading songs, the player quit on me.  Tried replacing batteries, did all the trouble shooting - nothing.  I purchased it January 30 2007 and it is now past the return to amazon.  Please someone tell me how to get my money back!!!!  

- I own the Zen Xtra, thought this was a upgrade, wrong, this unit functions like the ipod, no search function, poor screen vision and after 2 hours it froze had to remove battery to reboot. not what you expect from creative labs  

- If Apple makes everthing works as it advertized, then it's worth it.  

- I'm not sure if people are still buying this now but I just wanted to let you know that you can get a brand new 80GB video iPod for 349.00 (381.00 after tax in TN). I love mine and couldn't be happier!  

- Not a good compatibility with most of the song formats. When i try to transfer songs to this IPOD, it tries to convert them to itunes, which does not work for 50 % of the songs. I should have rather bought an mp3 player / flash drive.  

- It worked great for about 2 weeks and after that it has turned into nothing more than a problem. Don't spend your money on this product it is horrid. I don't think that I used this more than 10 times.  

- I buy two of these as a christmas present and didnt work im very angry whit this product, dont spent a penny for this! Compre dos de este producto como regalo de navidad y solo duro un solo dia! no vale la pena gastar un centavo!  

- This device its suposed to be USB 2.0  That means that a single 4MB mp3 file would take about a second to transfer. Oh no, it doesn't. It takes about 8 or 10 seconds per track. Now, multiply that for some 200 songs? Ridiculous. However, Amazon has nothing to do with this total failure.   

- this product stopped working after 2 days! i have 2 of them a nd neither one works like it's supposed to. they are not easy to use and will not sync like there're supposed to.  

- This thing is JUNK. If and when it works it has a mind of it's own.It will only work for a few minutes and then dump all of the songs in it. I have to constantly reload it with music.  Spend the money and buy a REAL MP-3 !!!!!!!!!  

- Bad product. It was supposed to give happines to my daugther and only provided tears... It worked perfectly by about two days.. after that... only to see the pretty design... Don't buy it by any reason. It's my suggestion.  

- Not as easy to use as the model it replaces.  Skips playing back book-on-mp3.  Volume control doesn't work correctly.    

- SanDisk MP3 player is very good. Satisfactory regarding the price/benefit. I have bought 2 already, for both daughters. I recommend it if you don't need to load a big ammount of music. It is very fast to load music and create lists.   

- At least mine turns on I guess.  Technical support for this item is a joke.  Good luck if you buy one!  

- Be careful when buying a mach speed product. Customer service is non existent. If you email tech support they will reply asking for   you to call them. Buying a player like this is a gamble. Save yourself the pain of begging for help and buy a reliable brand like Sony.    

- Could not use it, arrived defective from vendor. Spent almost a month before Amazon finaly ussued refund but still no word from vendor/manufacturer  

- I really wanted to buy something other than an ipod. Here's another option off the table. Thanks for NOT thinking of ~20% of consumers that don't have XP Creative.  

- Looks a lot like an iPod. I don't like the software as much as itunes. Wouldn't say this was a "bargain"  

- I was looking for a new MP3 player, since my husband's using my old one.  This was not the one. I've tried for over a week to get it working with no success. Don't be fooled by the price, it's not worth it.  Buy the iPOD. I am.   

- i order this item and it got lost in the mail. They resend it which was fine but, as soon as i recieve it i turn on the this item and the screen turned blank. I advised not to buy this item.  

- Bought the sucker in July, and in October it died inexplicably.  Would never buy another piece of junk from Creative.  

- Good product but software does not install (did not install with my XP system).  

- guys one thing is for sure the playback time is really low .....it dies down exactly when i need it and whats more pathetic is it erratic playback time ....sometimes lasts for 4 hours or even 3 hours .......PLEASE dont be misled by any reviews about battery life .........  

- Worked ok for the first couple months now it won't turn off.  Use a cover but didn't save this piece of junk.  got a san disk for a fraction of the cost and it works much better and more memory can be added with the san disk.  Get the san disk and avoid this cruddy fad piece of trash.  

- the ipod i have recieved never worked properly. getting it repaired with Apple was not the easiest experience.   

- I received a broken 80GB iPod, i am deployed, so therefor i have to send it to the states, and wait for apple to fix it and then wait to get it back!  The seller sux!!!!  

- You can not delete a song.  You have to delete everything.  You can not take any music from the IPOD to your computer. ITunes is very invasive.  Very dissapointing product.  Way over priced.  

- This item never worked!What more can you say! The company did'nt even know how to get it to work.  

- decent product as far as features go but I bought 2 of them, 1 for me  1 for  my son. On Both players the screen broke inside . Support is frustrating at best. Bottom line is I'm stuck with 2 useless and expensive mp3 players.  

- This piece of garbage worked for exactly two hours, completely froze up, and then would no longer even power up! Will NEVER buy another product made by SanDisk again!   

- I LIKE THE SIZE BUT THE DOWNLOAD TIME IS SOOOO SLOW.  I BOUGHT ANOTHER SAN DISK MP3 PLAYER AND IT IS 10 TIMES AS FAST AND WAS MUCH CHEAPER.  

- the player froze up after about a week worked with tech support downloaded patch, still had to order replacement. Replacement did the same thing within a week. Went out and bought an RCA mp3 player for the same price. Really suprised an sandisk product usually are good.  

- I returned this mp3 player because it kept shutting off and I would have to remove the battery and replace it to turn it back on i think it is not a good purchase. DON'T GET THIS TYPE OF MP3 PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   

- This works and is a good product.  The biggest problem for me is that it does not have a bookmarking feature, which is essential for books on tape.  FOr that reason, I'd go with a "Zen" type, or a more expensive Sansa model.  

- BEWARE this a MP3 that costs around $50.- but seller Blue Proton is trying to sell it in 4 times its regular price, this is before it had stock problems. I don't now how Amazon let this kind of sellers sell here...  

- great price, great brand, but unfortunately i got a lemon. loading the music was easy, but after one day of use, it froze in the start-up screen. it may be a good product, but mine was a lemon.  

- This product was terrible!! Wouldn't charge, wasn't compatible with my computer as it stated it was.  Sent it back for full refund.  

- I tried plugging this into the Microsoft XP and I can't hear anything, let alone watch any videos.  Apple stinks.  

- This company has some nerve.  They sell the products, then go absolutly dark on the customer service end.  ....Earth to iriver, come in irver!!!  anybody home????    

- I strongly believe Apple is a good product but this is the second one I purchased and both wouldn't hold a charge.    

- Shoddy hard drives, horrible customer service.  Archos is the worst on the market at the moment, and the subject of a massive pending class action suit.  AVOID.    

- This item is not worth over $100.  there is only 64 mbs on it   that fits like 10 songs on there  I advise you not to buy  

- Someone is going to have to write better instructions for this.  I really wanted to use this to download some books from the National Talking Books for the Blind and Disabled.  I never did get it and so I returned it for a refund.  

- It is not ready for market. Do not touch it.  

- We bought two of these. My husband likes his, but mine skips quite often - and the on/off button broke off within a week! I'd avoid it. Who knows how long it will be before my husband's falls apart?  

- got it on xmas day, the unit froze on the 2nd day, and repeated again within just a few days at which point it doesn't turn on anymore.  I returned it within 2 weeks and bought an ipod nano, never had any problems since!  

- I had to return it after 2 days of trying - It just kept hanging - The buttons and the body finish was very cheap - plastic like - and they did not repond correctly - A very bad product.  

- I have only had my Zen for about 5 months and it's already freezing up. I have to keep resetting it but to no avail. I think I should have paid exrta money and went with iPod.  

- Thought it was a great deal.  It looked decent and I was able to download music okay.  The only thing is that it is always freezing up and then won't even turn off.  I keep having to remove the battery to restart it.  Don't bother with this piece of junk!!!  

-  Ipods have been good for quite a while now but this new version is prone to problems I suggest the next one.  

- i returned it 2 days later, after i've found out ipod nano and old ipod are more responsive. how come apple allow supposedly new products to be released with less impressive user experience than the one they hope to repalce...  

- The Itouch I recieved was defective. Bad battery. I'm still in process of replacing it.  

- Recentley bought 2 shoqboxs from diffrent sources one of witch did not work at all the other took a crap on me after downloading music onto it. After returning both and wasting everybodys time decided to stick with ipod... till philips gets its stuff together.  

- So Steve Jobs has come out with another invention to make apple fans all but cream from excitement? Big Whoop. There are hundreds of mp3 and mp4 players out there that do 2x as good a job at half the price. More memory, smaller price tag, new body. So What? Meizu and Sansa are what I'm with.   

- this may be great for music but if you listen to audiobooks, don't even think about it! doesn't reliably resume (return to previous point) and fast forward takes forever, especially if you're trying to get through hours of already heard "pages" to wherever  you left off.  

- One headphone quit working 3 days after christmas and now the player wont do anything but make funny noises-doesnt play any music any more  

- Bought this because I already have Napster to go.  Won't work with that or Rhapsody.  SanDisk people say that it can only paly music ripped from CD.  Very unsatisfied!  

- Came with ear buds that one wire to one was way longer than the other, luckily I had other sets. It has flaws in the music that is loaded into it,  even though I know the songs are flawless on the PC. I do not recommend buying this product and am most likely going to return it.    

- needs more refining,I had 2 of them had the same problem,when you record vidio on them voice does not match the picture.I returned them thanks to amazon customer service understanding.  

- I opened up the package, saw how cheap it was, and packed it back up and returned it.  

- Bought this from JR. They accepted my order,charged my card then cancelled the order 2 days later because they did not have it in stock. This is the Computer age? You dont know if it's in stock or not? C'mon. Bought the item elsewhere for more because it was a Xmas gift. Wife loves it, it's great.  

- This product worked well at first. The sound was great and it was easy to understand. I battery power was long lasting but it didn't even last 3 months of regular usage. It stopped working for no reason. Now it doesn't even turn on.  This player just .... Don't buy this junk.  

- Right features, bad design [bad] quality for [a high price] I would have appreciated more than a couple of months of use.  Stay away from this unit and buy the next generation.  

- If you plan on upgrading your OS to windows XP - do not bother with any Creative Labs products.  They are going to take monthes to make drivers available  

- This MP3 Player only lasted two weeks in my possession.  Despite new batteries, the unit never played another tune after limited use.  Would not recommend this for a purchase.  Now I guess I know why it was 47% off the regular price.  

- Right out of the box, the unit will not power up.  Tried 3 different batteries and still cannot get any power.  I guess this unit's defective....very disappointing!  

- After half a year, mine doesn't play music anymore, but the USB drive still works. And I've treated it well, it was never banged around. Appears to have a quality problem... avoid it...  

- Got my Nomad Muvoabout 5 months ago and now its dead and out of warranty. (3 months limited warranty)<br>The unit performed alright while it worked however.<br>Avoid if you want something that lasts.  

- At first I thought this was a terrific little gizmo --so cute, so tiny, so easy to use -- but mine stopped working after 4 hours of play. The memory module still functioned, but the playback bit was dead as a doornail. So back to the store it went. Too bad, I would have liked it to work out.  

- Nomad MUVO 128 MB worked for 2-days and then it packed-up. It does not work any more with battery pack even with new batteries...  

- you may be like me and think that this is the coolest new thing to hit the market but its not its a great idea and all but its just not ready yet if you want somethign good get an ipod they rock.  

- I am really disappointed with the iPod. I use it for the PC and have had to re-install the software almost daily.  The iPod skips on three out of five songs.  Apple support is non-responsive and very difficult to contact.  Save yourself lots of money and avoid the iPod  

- Software does not work with Mac OSX. Hopefully there is a download on the Nike-Philips wesite.  

- Will not work with OSX. No downloads available as of 2/3/03<p>Horrid install on XP<p>The problem is the software not the device - but too bad.<p>Sent it back  

- This unit is only $79.99 at BestBuy.  I thought Amazon matched prices but apparently they don't.  I told them about the price five days ago and they still have not changed it.  

- It is very difficult to download/upload it crashes a lot, and it give you a lot of warnings, i regreet to buy this items<p>SKS  

- Having given 4 of these players as gifts, it is disheartning to have all of them to require service within 6-8 months. Total lack of quality and reliablity, plus customer service that really suks.  Wish I had looked else where for players.  

- My 40 GB Ipod died after 4 months and had to be sent back to Apple for repair. They sent me a new one which also died after 4 months. Very similar experience to previous poster. It seems there is a serious design flaw with the 40 GB Ipod. I definitely would not bother buying this.  

- Bottom line I have had to have my iPod replaced three times, for the same problem, until apple finally refunded my purchase.  Maybe the old ones were good- but not the new ones.  

- I bought this after many online reviews and I was quite disappointed with it.  My main reason is due to the fact that the machine DIED only after two weeks of use.  It was in no way mishandled either!!    Buy with EXTREME caution.     I KNEW I should have bought an iPod.   

- Now that the nano is out, why buy this one?  I was told that you cannot run with this iPod, although you can run with the nano.  And since the prices are comparable, this one is obsolete.  

- I orded 2 of these:  one for each daughter.  One of the units failed after 3 days, the replacement failed after 6 days.  I've been informed by Amazon that there exists a widespread defect issue with this product.  

- I bought this for my sister for her birthday.  It didn't work.  I contacted the company, which took way too long to respond.  They said the problem was mechanical. I sent it in for repair. They sent it back and it worked... for a few weeks. Now it won't start up anymore.  Do NOT buy this product.  

- The reason the previous reviewer could not get the built in memory to work is almost certainly that there is no built in memory.  Or at least, there isn't any in the unit I received.  Not 128 mb, not any mb.  So don't buy this thing unless you also buy a memory card for it.  

- Very difficult to use. Functions are not easily accessible. I own 8 MP3 players (sony, creative 2, mobiblu, iriver, ipod, sansa). This is the worst one. You can use 40GB drive to transfer files but not for music.  

- Wheels are very small; harder to use compare to HDD ipod. Scratch problem is just horrid. Typical ipod sound quality, slightly less output than 4th gen ipods, but same clarity of sound.  

- 1) The ipod nano does not have recording ability  2) The ipod nano is too fragile  3) The ipod nano is only $60 less than a real ipod.  Do not waste your money on an ipod nano.  

- I puchased one of these for my son, and just a few days past the warranty expiration, the device starts freezing up. He e-mailed with someone at Zen (there is no phone number available for these people, btw)and the player has been declared broken. I am very disappointed in this product.  

- Got one from eBay for $20 (shipping included). This is my second MP3 player. My previous one is a Creative Labs MuVo TX/FM 256MB. I think the MuVo is a better MP3 player then e130 in four ways:  1. Better FM radio reception. 2. Better battary lift. 3. Better sound quality. 4. Better built.    

- I agree completely D.Welker!! The same thing happend to me also with the head-jack! They need to do a product RECALL! At first the product works really well then after awhile of use it starts to 'malfunction' increasing from that one problem. I woudn't recommend this product to anyone.   

- When I bought this I was so excited. It seemed to be working fine for like the first two days but then i was listening to a song and it froze. Now i have to send it to customer service and hope they will fix it  

- It HASN'T been released yet - what are these people talking about?  They probably have not even touched one of these yet.  RCA doesn't even acknowledge this product on their web site yet?  

- I ordered this product on September 2nd WHOLESALERS CLUB said it shipped on September 5th US Priority Mail. My Postmaster can NOT find it anywhere. I never receied it. NOBODY responds to my attempts to contact them. That includes Amazon and Wholesalers club. Martin King  

- A news article even said that to work an iriver properly most of the time, you have to download music. You can't just rip cds to it like you can with the ipods. Definitely not recomend this item. Just go back to faithful apple for good mp3 players.  

- Try ripping your CD's with the track number in front so that the file name reads "01 artist-track" then "02 artist-track" etc etc rather than just "artist-track" just a thought,,,i don't own this m3p palyer.  

- Unstable, terrible battery life, slow between apps, protective sleeve is clumsy to use.  I traded it for the TX.   

- worst experience. hangs so much and restart from scratch wasting your whole time. Unreliable. I have returned to amazone. Kashif  

- The tracks have a tic that repeats every second, i.e. all voice recordings have a tic tic tic tic in the background.    

- I love IPODS, but I have had to buy 3 in 18 months!  They keep having problems and getting them fixed is a nightmare.  I finally realized that I was going to have to shell out the money for a new one about every six months.  I wish Apple had come out with a more reliable product!  

- AMAZON FAIL TO DELIVER ITEM WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME.  THE ITEM FAIL TO ARRIVE AND THEREFORE WE NEVER RECEIVED THE GOODS  

- WARNING!!  This player only works with Windows Media Player 10, which has been replaced by WMP 11 6 months ago.  Philips does not seem to be interested in updating this unit.  IT IS UNUSABLE IF YOUR COMPUTER IS NEW OR HAS BEEN UPDATED TO WMP 11 !!!  

- One day it frooze, nothing unusual so I rebooted it to have it tell me to connect it to my PC.  I did but now my PC won't recognize it and it is making a clicking sound.  Definately a hardware problem.  I have heard this from several people now and Philips won't recognize the problem.  

- I had this and a phillips TV. Both broke, both times Phillips did crap. I'm never buying from this company again and I could not recommend you buy from them either.   

- I have 2 of them.  One stop working after 1 month of use. It`s difficult to go from one menu to another and use it in general.  

- This thing is a piece of junk. It stops working in between of a song for no reason. u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much.  

- I brought this peice two months ago. It never worked. This is a peice of junk to through in garbage. If you want to through your money like that, just donate your money to somebody. May be 1 in 10000 will work properly.Lot better products than this you can buy.    

- after few months it just stopped working.  also, it is not rechargable, and need to replace batery every 1-2 weeks  

- Cute device. Plugged it into XP computer, found the device, assigned it to drive G. Tried to look at G, said Insert disk for drive G.   Technical support line busy. Finally got through, talked to someone for 2 minutes, they put me on hold and then hung up.  I am returning it tomorrow.  

- Broke after 2 months of use. froze up. Called customer service. Was no help. poor quality. can hardly see screen. would never purchase sandisk again.   

- I have had 3 of these MP3 players. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! All 3 died within a week of purchase. JUNK JUNK JUNK. Pay a bit more nad get an ipod!  

- I loaded 16 gigs of my music and listened for 3 days before it completely died. It gave me an error message, and then went to a black screen. It will not charge. It will not play. But it looks cool on my desk. I took it back and won't get another.  

- The item boke up and stopped working after a month of being purchased.  

- This looked like a good product but it did not work properly when we received it and I believe it does not interface with Mac computers. We returned it after a day of trying to make it work and paid the extra money for an iPod.  

- I loved that this player was relatively cheap for what its capabilities are... videos are clear, sound quality is high, but after only having it for about 3.5 months it broke and i had to send it in to get fixed, which also takes about 3 weeks.  Im not saying they are all like this, but mine was.  

- I have only used this product for 3 days. The power suddenly turned off and can never be turned on again. I have to return it to Amazon. The bad thing is that I have loaded some my 2-year-old son's video into it, now I can not delete the files before the return.   

- Amazon cancelled my order and I never received it from Amazon, I had to purchase it from Calumet on my own. So my first experience w/ Amazon was bad.  

- despues q amazon me lo vendio me mandaro un email diciendo q fue sobre vendido. q ahora no estaba disponible..pero me querian vender otro de 2gb por un precio mas alto...no good  

- Apple just released the next 6th generation iPods at a press conference today dropping the prices, introducing new features and expanding the memory and now Amazon has raised the prices of the old iPods. What is going on???  

- With the advent of the new 160GB iPod, which Amazon.Com also sells, the retail price of this model is now only $249. I'm surprised that Amazon has not updated the price.  

- Had this about 1 1/2 weeks.  Froze up more times than I can even remember. Too bad-when working it is a nice unit but can not deal with the constant freezes and resetting needed.  It was returned to Amazon for a refund.  

- I bought this for my 14yr old son. After 3 months it froze and would no longer work.  SanDisk should be ashamed for producing products that are disposable after only a few months!  

- The player was alright for a while but after like a month the display stopped showing any text and then it stopped linking up to my computer properly and when you call customer service at sandisk they are of little to no help. Overall I would not advise this item  

- I would have liked to review this item, but, unfortunately, it got stolen before I could even see it. It was stolen out of the box, from my front porch.  

- Very cheaply constructed, terrible customer service and it broke within a week and SanDisk wouldn't take it back.  Tiger Direct however was awesome and completely stood behind the sale.  I wouldn't buy another SanDisk product.    

- I loved the concept and have run many miles with this little thing attached to my shirt.  I would give it 5 stars if I was not on my third docking station which is again beginning to falter like the previous two.  I am out of warranty and don't want to throw good money after bad!!!  

- Difficult to install and fill with music.  Locked up after two weeks of use and had to be returned for repair.  Awaiting return.  Better luck with SanDisk.  

- great to play on the go but not fully compatible w/outlook No mail comp. & not imac support,can't make task on the go & very hard to make play list on the go.great screen awesome to play music (as long as you dont want to make the play list on the go.)  

- This unit does not have a resume feature, which is a must if you use this for spoken-word audio.  Other MP3 players from Ultra Products are having their firmware upgraded, and will correct this shortcoming, but Ultra Products has not committed to upgrading the firmware for this unit.  

- This product is not compatible with Windows Vista.  This was a Christmas gift that will be going back.    

- I have sent this item back twice. Talked to rep and they said that whole inventory of ipods are messed up. They are refunded my money.   

- I fell in love with this MP3 player. It was small, so convenient, great sound etc. It just stopped working one day. It just won't turn on. I've changed the battery but to no avail. Now I have a useless little piece of plastic that I cant return or fix. $50 for 3 months of music!  

- I have a macbook. I couldn't get it to charge on the macbook so I bought a usb charger. I have just had the thing charging all night and no power. I've had the sansa a few weeks.  

- Liked the product until tried to add 2GB Kingston MicroSD card.  Player became unstable, and extra memory was undetected.  Web discussions indicate others have had same problems.  Very disappointed.  

- the shaker would not read the card.  i called sandisk several times to get assistant, and it still did not read the card.    

- The only music files it reads is mp3. So it was not easy for me at all to get music on to it. All my music was in wma format and nothing would play. I plan on returning. Just to much hassel for me. Not what I expected.   

- is not good the battery is going down very fast ,life battery maximo 65 minutes  

- I bought this and eagerly waited for it. it worked for about 36 hours then gave me a white screen of death. So Amazon sent me another one with no issue. The second one didn't work at all. Amazon let me return them without any hassle. Once I get my refund I'll buy a different but similar product.  

- Very easy to use, the videos look great. Screen went black after 2 weeks. I should have bought Ipod nano.  

- Was really looking forward to getting this, but charged once and then dead. Had to return item. Not getting another, guess going to wait and see what else comes up  

- I received the item & it didn't work. I contacted Amazon & they no longer have the item. It was an Xmas gift for my daughter, who was very disappointed. I could only be offered a refund after they receive the item back & confirm it is defective.  Overall - Disappointed!!!  

- This product is a great idea, but needs alot of work. First off it only holds 30 minutes of music - that needs to be expanded. The second problem is that to get the MP3s on the Rio you need a Microsoft WIndows machine.  This completely ignores Macintosh and other operating systems.  

- It is not worth it yet to buy something that has such a little amount of recording time at a poor quallity of music. You are limited in getting the mp3 format also. You need a pc computer with the internet. Maybe a later  upgrade but for now get something better.  

- I got this Nomad for free.  After 1 week (3 uses), and the thing will not turn on (the play button).  Now, what I have is a USB storage device (NO MP3 player).  If you received 2 weeks use out of the player consider yourself lucky.  

- well I did try a few things and the thing seems to be working again after I had given up on it.  I downloaded the latest firmware from the website and also reformatted it.  Now its working again so I'm crossing my fingers to see how long this one will last again.  

- I was disapointed in the quality and controls. The USB connection worked great,  It did not need any drivers or installation to work under XP, but the unit stopped working after a few months and had to be sent back to Creative for repairs. the repairs cost as much as a new player so why bother.  

- The thing is cheaper at the circuit city website. That's all I have to say about it.  

- Apple just made a 15 gig ipod for the same price as the 10 gig.  Do not buy the 10 gig Ipod because it is being discontinued.  15 gig is now the lowest model.  look for yourself at apple.com  

- Don't be fooled by Apple's assurances that their new IPod will work with a PC. It won't. Yes, there is supplementary software, and a Firewire attachment. But when you hook the whole thing up, the chances are it won't work...  

- No star!! Dark night ! It never works and no help from Apple website, not even answering emails ,(only Amazon does )   Very bad reference , no care at all for customer service  !  

- the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out  

- The FM transmitter is worthless.  There isn't a 12 volt cigarette adapter available in the US per Samsung.  Mine didn't work with songs purchased from Napster, a real problem.  The backlight is not adjustable and too dim to really help in a car at night.  Would not recommend.  

- Seriously Apple!!! My iPod fell of my computer table in a protective case and when i listen to music ON FULL VOLUME it has scratches and you can hardly hear the music!!! Save TIME and MONEY and buy something else!!  

- Purchased Rio Carbon last January. After numerous calls to Rio due to faulty software, firmware, etc., I then had to have unit replaced three times! The scroll wheel broke twice! Rio has gone out of business, having sold out to another company.The price has dropped 30% for a reason.  Stay away!  

- It should be a good product but the one I buy only worked for an hour then I bring it to the apple store to get it fixed and they was so nasty about it. They was going to give me a Reconditioned one to repart my new one. NO more ipod they suck.  

- This made in China mp3 player looks very cheap from day one. Bought it in March, 2005 and used it for 2 month and it's broke. The customer service put me on hold for a long time as well. Save yourself the trouble and get something else.  

- It's tiny and cute only when it is working. Mine died on the first battery, about 4-hour usage.   

- The headphone jack WILL go out on you, it is a defect in this product.  Go ahead, google "headphone jack creative zen micro" and see what comes up.  On top of everything Creative is doing nothing as a company to combat this issue!  DO NOT BUY ANY CREATIVE PRODUCTS!  

- I own one of these and when I installed windows media player 11 it made it obsolete! Samsung will tell you too bad go buy a new one. DO NOT buy from Samsung they have planned their devices to be obsolete!  

- I bought this product a year ago, and now I can not use it. The battery is shot, and it can't access its own hard drive. I can't get it to re-boot and the people at apple are being useless. I'm buying a creative Zen for many reasons, including its removable battery.
